              "text": "# If Statement\nAn `if` statement is a conditional statement that runs or skips code based on whether a condition is true or false. Here's a simple example.\n```python\nif phone_balance < 5:\n    phone_balance += 10\n    bank_balance -= 10\n```\nLet's break this down.\n1. An `if` statement starts with the `if` keyword, followed by the condition to be checked, in this case `phone_balance < 5`, and then a colon. The condition is specified in a boolean expression that evaluates to either True or False.<br><br>\n2. After this line is an indented block of code to be executed if that condition is true. Here, the lines that increment `phone_balance` and decrement `bank_balance` only execute if it is true that `phone_balance` is less than 5. If not, the code in this `if` block is simply skipped.\n\n### Use Comparison Operators in Conditional Statements\nYou have learned about Python's comparison operators (e.g. `==` and `!=`) and how they are different from assignment operators (e.g. `=`). In conditional statements, you want to use comparison operators. For example, you'd want to use `if x == 5` rather than `if x = 5`. If your conditional statement is causing a syntax error or doing something unexpected, check whether you have written `==` or `=`! \n\n",

              "text": "# If, Elif, Else\nIn addition to the `if` clause, there are two other optional clauses often used with an `if` statement. For example:\n```python\nif season == 'spring':\n    print('plant the garden!')\nelif season == 'summer':\n    print('water the garden!')\nelif season == 'fall':\n    print('harvest the garden!')\nelif season == 'winter':\n    print('stay indoors!')\nelse:\n    print('unrecognized season')\n```\n1. `if`: An `if` statement must always start with an `if` clause, which contains the first condition that is checked. If this evaluates to True, Python runs the code indented in this `if` block and then skips to the rest of the code after the `if` statement.<br><br>\n2. `elif`: `elif` is short for \"else if.\" An `elif` clause is used to check for an additional condition if the conditions in the previous clauses in the `if` statement evaluate to False. As you can see in the example, you can have multiple `elif` blocks to handle different situations.<br><br>\n3. `else`: Last is the `else` clause, which must come at the end of an `if` statement if used. This clause doesn't require a condition. The code in an `else` block is run if all conditions above that in the `if` statement evaluate to False.",

For example, `if` statements use indentation to tell Python what code is inside and outside of different clauses.\n\nIn Python, indents conventionally come in multiples of four spaces. Be strict about following this convention, because changing the indentation can completely change the meaning of the code. If you are working on a team of Python programmers, it's important that everyone follows the same indentation convention!\n\n#### Spaces or Tabs?\nThe [Python Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#tabs-or-spaces) recommends using 4 spaces to indent, rather than using a tab. Whichever you use, be aware that \"Python 3 disallows mixing the use of tabs and spaces for indentation.\" \n\n______\n",

You won a wooden rabbit!\"\nelif points <= 150:\n    result = \"Oh dear, no prize this time.\"\nelif points <= 180:\n    result = \"Congratulations! You won a wafer-thin mint!\"\nelse:\n    result = \"Congratulations! You won a penguin!\"\n\nprint(result)\n```\n### Output:\n```txt\nCongratulations! You won a wafer-thin mint!\n```\nWe use `<=` instead of the `<` operator, since it was stated that the upper bound is inclusive. Notice that in each condition, we check if `points` is in a prize bracket by checking if `points` is less than or equal to the upper bound; we didn't have to check if it was greater than the lower bound. Let's see why this is the case.\n\n- When `points = 174`, it first checks if `points <= 50`, which evaluates to False. We don't have to check if it is also greater than 0, since it is stated in the problem that `points` will always be a positive integer up to 200. \n\n- Since the first condition evaluates to False,  it moves on to check the next condition, `points <= 150`. __We don't need to check if it is also greater than 50 here!__ We already know this is the case because the first condition has to have evaluated to False in order to get to this point. If we know `points <= 50` is False, then `points > 50` must be True!\n\n- Finally, we check if `points <= 180`, which evaluates to True. We now know that `points` is in the 151 - 180 bracket.\n\n- The last prize bracket, 181-200, is caught in the `else` clause, since there is no other possible value of the prize after checking the previous conditions.",

Don't use `True` or `False` as conditions\n```python\n# Bad example\nif True:\n    print(\"This indented code will always get run.\")\n```\nWhile \"True\" is a valid boolean expression, it's not useful as a condition since it always evaluates to True, so the indented code will always get run. Similarly, `if False` is not a condition you should use either - the statement following this `if` statement would never be executed. \n```python\n# Another bad example\nif is_cold or not is_cold:\n    print(\"This indented code will always get run.\")\n```\nSimilarly, it's useless to use any condition that you know will always evaluate to True, like this example above. A boolean variable can only be True or False, so either `is_cold` or `not is_cold` is always True, and the indented code will always be run.\n\n### 2. Be careful writing expressions that use logical operators\nLogical operators `and`, `or` and `not` have specific meanings that aren't quite the same as their meanings in plain English. Make sure your boolean expressions are being evaluated the way you expect them to. \n```python\n# Bad example\nif weather == \"snow\" or \"rain\":\n    print(\"Wear boots!\")\n```\nThis code is valid in Python, but it is not a boolean expression, although it reads like one. The reason is that the expression to the right of the `or` operator, `\"rain\"`, is not a boolean expression - it's a string! Later we'll discuss what happens when you use non-boolean-type objects in place of booleans.\n\n### 3. Don't compare a boolean variable with `== True` or `== False`\nThis comparison isn’t necessary, since the boolean variable itself is a boolean expression.\n```python\n# Bad example\nif is_cold == True:\n    print(\"The weather is cold!\")\n```\nThis is a valid condition, but we can make the code more readable by using the variable itself as the condition instead, as below.\n```python\n# Good example\nif is_cold:\n    print(\"The weather is cold!\")\n```\nIf you want to check whether a boolean is False, you can use the `not` operator.",

By default, the truth value of an object in Python is considered True unless specified as False in the documentation.\n\nHere are most of the built-in objects that are considered False in Python:\n- constants defined to be false: `None` and `False`\n- zero of any numeric type: `0`, `0.0`, `0j`, `Decimal(0)`, `Fraction(0, 1)`\n- empty sequences and collections: `'\"\"`, `()`, `[]`, `{}`, `set()`, `range(0)`\n\nExample:\n```python\nerrors = 3\nif errors:\n    print(\"You have {} errors to fix!\".format(errors))\nelse:\n    print(\"No errors to fix!\")\n```\nIn this code, `errors` has the truth value True because it's a non-zero number, so the error message is printed.

              "text": "# For Loops\nPython has two kinds of loops - `for` loops and `while` loops. A `for` loop is used to \"iterate\", or do something repeatedly, over an **iterable**. \n\nAn __iterable__ is an object that can return one of its elements at a time. This can include sequence types, such as strings, lists, and tuples, as well as non-sequence types, such as dictionaries and files.\n\n### Example\nLet's break down the components of a `for` loop, using this example with the list `cities`:\n```python\ncities = ['new york city', 'mountain view', 'chicago', 'los angeles']\nfor city in cities:\n    print(city)\nprint(\"Done!\")\n```\n\n#### Components of a `for` Loop\n1. The first line of the loop starts with the `for` keyword, which signals that this is a `for` loop\n2. Following that is `city in cities`, indicating `city` is the iteration variable, and `cities` is the iterable being looped over. In the first iteration of the loop, `city` gets the value of the first element in `cities`, which is “new york city”.\n3. The `for` loop heading line always ends with a colon `:`\n4. Following the `for` loop heading is an indented block of code, the body of the loop, to be executed in each iteration of this loop. There is only one line in the body of this loop - `print(city)`.\n5. After the body of the loop has executed, we don't move on to the next line yet; we go back to the `for` heading line, where the iteration variable takes the value of the next element of the iterable. In the second iteration of the loop above, `city` takes the value of the next element in `cities`, which is \"mountain view\". \n6. This process repeats until the loop has iterated through all the elements of the iterable. Then, we move on to the line that follows the body of the loop - in this case, `print(\"Done!\")`. We can tell what the next line after the body of the loop is because it is unindented. Here is another reason why paying attention to your indentation is very important in Python!\n\nExecuting the code in the example above produces this output:\n```txt\nnew york city\nmountain view\nchicago\nlos angeles\nDone!\n```\n\nYou can name iteration variables however you like. A common pattern is to give the iteration variable and iterable the same names, except the singular and plural versions respectively (e.g., 'city' and 'cities').\n\n### Using the `range()` Function with `for` Loops\n`range()` is a built-in function used to create an iterable sequence of numbers. You will frequently use `range()` with a `for` loop to repeat an action a certain number of times. Any variable can be used to iterate through the numbers, but Python programmers conventionally use `i`, as in this example: \n\n```python\nfor i in range(3):\n    print(\"Hello!\")\n```\nOutput:\n```txt\nHello!\nHello!\nHello!\n```\n\n#### `range(start=0, stop, step=1)`\nThe `range()` function takes three integer arguments, the first and third of which are optional:\n- The 'start' argument is the first number of the sequence. If unspecified, 'start' defaults to 0.\n- The 'stop' argument is 1 more than the last number of the sequence. This argument must be specified.\n- The 'step' argument is the difference between each number in the sequence. If unspecified, 'step' defaults to 1.\n\nNotes on using `range()`:\n- If you specify one integer inside the parentheses with`range()`, it's used as the value for 'stop,' and the defaults are used for the other two.  \n__e.g. -__ `range(4)` returns `0, 1, 2, 3`\n- If you specify two integers inside the parentheses with`range()`, they're used for 'start' and 'stop,' and the default is used for 'step.'  \n__e.g. -__ `range(2, 6)` returns `2, 3, 4, 5`\n- Or you can specify all three integers for 'start', 'stop', and 'step.'  \n__e.g. -__ `range(1, 10, 2)` returns `1, 3, 5, 7, 9`\n\n### Creating and Modifying Lists\nIn addition to extracting information from lists, as we did in the first example above, you can also create and modify lists with `for` loops. You can **create** a list by appending to a new list at each iteration of the `for` loop like this:\n```python\n# Creating a new list\ncities = ['new york city', 'mountain view', 'chicago', 'los angeles']\ncapitalized_cities = []\n\nfor city in cities:\n    capitalized_cities.append(city.title())\n```\n**Modifying** a list is a bit more involved, and requires the use of the `range()` function. \n\nWe can use the `range()` function to generate the indices for each value in the `cities` list. This lets us access the elements of the list with `cities[index]` so that we can modify the values in the `cities` list in place.\n```python\ncities = ['new york city', 'mountain view', 'chicago', 'los angeles']\n\nfor index in range(len(cities)):\n    cities[index] = cities[index].title()\n```\n",

              "text": "# Building Dictionaries\nBy now you are familiar with two important concepts: 1) counting with `for` loops and 2) the dictionary `get` method. These two can actually be combined to create a useful counter dictionary, something you will likely come across again. For example, we can create a dictionary, `word_counter`, that keeps track of the total count of each word in a string.\n\nThe following are a couple of ways to do it:\n### Method 1: Using a `for` loop to create a set of counters\n\nLet's start with a list containing the words in a series of book titles:\n```\nbook_title =  ['great', 'expectations','the', 'adventures', 'of', 'sherlock','holmes','the','great','gasby','hamlet','adventures','of','huckleberry','fin']\n```\n**Step 1: ** Create an empty dictionary.\n```\nword_counter = {}```\n**Step 2.** Iterate through each element in the list. If an element is already included in the dictionary, add 1 to its value. If not, add the element to the dictionary and set its value to 1.\n```\nfor word in book_title:\n    if word not in word_counter:\n        word_counter[word] = 1\n    else:\n        word_counter[word] += 1```\n\n#####  What's happening here?\n- The `for` loop iterates through each element in the list. For the first iteration, `word` takes the value 'great'.\n- Next, the if statement checks if `word` is in the `word_counter` dictionary.\n- Since it doesn't yet, the statement  `word_counter[word] = 1` adds *great* as a key to the dictionary with a value of 1.\n- Then, it leaves the if else statement and moves on to the next iteration of the for loop. `word` now takes the value *expectations* and repeats the process.\n- When the if condition is not met, it is because that`word` already exists in the `word_counter` dictionary, and the statement `word_counter[word] = word_counter[word] + 1` increases the count of that word by 1.\n- Once the `for` loop finishes iterating through the list, the `for` loop is complete. \n\nWe can see the output by printing out the dictionary. Printing `word_counter` results in the following output.\n```\n{'great': 2, 'expectations': 1, 'the': 2, 'adventures': 2, 'of': 2, 'sherlock': 1, 'holmes': 1, 'gasby': 1, 'hamlet': 1, 'huckleberry': 1, 'fin': 1}\n```\nFeel free to try this out yourself in the code editor at the bottom of this page.",

Except unlike indexing, this will return a default value if the key is not found. If unspecified, this default value is set to None. We can use `get` with a default value of 0 to simplify the code from the first method above.\n```\nfor word in book_title:\n    word_counter[word] = word_counter.get(word, 0) + 1```\n\n#####  What's happening here?\n- The `for` loop iterates through the list as we saw earlier. The `for` loop feeds 'great' to the next statement in the body of the `for` loop.\n-   In this line: ` word_counter[word] = word_counter.get(word,0) + 1`, since the key *'great'* doesn't yet exist in the dictionary, `get()` will return the value 0 and `word_counter[word]` will be set to 1.\n- Once it encounters a word that already exists in `word_counter` (e.g. the second appearance of *'the'*),  the  value for that key is incremented by 1. On the second appearance of 'the', the key's value would add 1 again, resulting in 2.\n- Once the `for` loop finishes iterating through the list, the `for` loop is complete.\n\nPrinting `word_counter` shows us we get the same result as we did in method 1.\n```\n{'great': 2, 'expectations': 1, 'the': 2, 'adventures': 2, 'of': 2, 'sherlock': 1, 'holmes': 1, 'gasby': 1, 'hamlet': 1, 'huckleberry': 1, 'fin': 1}\n```\nAgain, feel free to try this out yourself in the code editor below.",

              "text": "# Iterating Through Dictionaries with `For` Loops\nWhen you iterate through a dictionary using a `for` loop, doing it the normal way (`for n in some_dict`) will only give you access to the __keys__ in the dictionary - which is what you'd want in some situations. In other cases, you'd want to iterate through both the __keys__ and __values__ in the dictionary. Let's see how this is done in an example. Consider this dictionary that uses names of actors as keys and their characters as values.\n```python\ncast = {\n           \"Jerry Seinfeld\": \"Jerry Seinfeld\",\n           \"Julia Louis-Dreyfus\": \"Elaine Benes\",\n           \"Jason Alexander\": \"George Costanza\",\n           \"Michael Richards\": \"Cosmo Kramer\"\n       }\n```\nIterating through it in the usual way with a `for` loop would give you just the keys, as shown below:\n```python\nfor key in cast:\n    print(key)\n```\nThis outputs:\n```txt\nJerry Seinfeld\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus\nJason Alexander\nMichael Richards\n```\nIf you wish to iterate through both keys and values, you can use the built-in method `items` like this:\n```python\nfor key, value in cast.items():\n    print(\"Actor: {}    Role: {}\".format(key, value))\n```\nThis outputs:\n```txt\nActor: Jerry Seinfeld    Role: Jerry Seinfeld\nActor: Julia Louis-Dreyfus    Role: Elaine Benes\nActor: Jason Alexander    Role: George Costanza\nActor: Michael Richards    Role: Cosmo Kramer\n```\n`items` is an awesome method that returns tuples of key, value pairs, which you can use to iterate over dictionaries in `for` loops.",

              "text": "# `While` Loops\n`For` loops are an example of \"definite iteration\" meaning that the loop's body is run a predefined number of times. This differs from \"indefinite iteration\" which is when a loop repeats an unknown number of times and ends when some condition is met, which is what happens in a `while` loop. Here's an example of a `while` loop.\n```python\ncard_deck = [4, 11, 8, 5, 13, 2, 8, 10]\nhand = []\n\n# adds the last element of the card_deck list to the hand list\n# until the values in hand add up to 17 or more\nwhile sum(hand)  < 17:\n    hand.append(card_deck.pop())\n```\nThis example features two new functions. `sum` returns the sum of the elements in a list, and `pop` is a list method that removes the last element from a list and returns it.\n\n### Components of a `While` Loop\n1. The first line starts with the `while` keyword, indicating this is a `while` loop.\n2. Following that is a condition to be checked. In this example, that's `sum(hand) <= 17`.\n3. The `while` loop heading always ends with a colon `:`.\n4. Indented after this heading is the body of the `while` loop. If the condition for the `while` loop is true, the code lines in the loop's body will be executed. \n5. We then go back to the `while` heading line, and the condition is evaluated again. This process of checking the condition and then executing the loop repeats until the condition becomes false. \n6. When the condition becomes false, we move on to the line following the body of the loop, which will be unindented.\n\nThe indented body of the loop should modify at least one variable in the test condition. If the value of the test condition never changes, the result is an infinite loop!",

For each number, if the number is prime, the code should print that the number is a prime number. If the number is NOT a prime number, it should print that the number is not a prime number, and also print a factor of that number besides 1 and the number itself.\n\n\n** Logic for our solution:**\n- We loop through each number in the `check_prime` list. \n- Create a \"search-for-factors\" loop beginning at 2, and continuing up to the (number-1)\n- Use a conditional statement with the`modulo operator` to check if our number when divided by the possible factor yields any remainder besides 0.\n- If we ever find one factor, we can declare that the number is not prime, and state the factor we found. Then we can break out of the loop for that number. \n- If we get up to the (number - 1) and haven't broken out of the loop, then we can declare that the number is prime.\n\n\n** Here is our solution.**\n```\ncheck_prime = [26, 39, 51, 53, 57, 79, 85]\n\n# iterate through the check_prime list\nfor num in check_prime:\n\n# search for factors, iterating through numbers ranging from 2 to the number itself\n    for i in range(2, num):\n\n# number is not prime if modulo is 0\n        if (num % i) == 0:\n            print(\"{} is NOT a prime number, because {} is a factor of {}\".format(num, i, num))\n            break\n\n# otherwise keep checking until we've searched all possible factors, and then declare it prime\n        if i == num -1:    \n            print(\"{} IS a prime number\".format(num))\n```\n",

For example, printing \n\n`list(zip(['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2, 3]))` would output `[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]`.\n\nLike we did for `range()` we need to convert it to a list or iterate through it with a loop to see the elements.\n\nYou could unpack each tuple in a `for` loop like this.\n```python\nletters = ['a', 'b', 'c']\nnums = [1, 2, 3]\n\nfor letter, num in zip(letters, nums):\n    print(\"{}: {}\".format(letter, num))\n```\nIn addition to zipping two lists together, you can also unzip a list into tuples using an asterisk.\n```python\nsome_list = [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]\nletters, nums = zip(*some_list)\n```\nThis would create the same `letters` and `nums` tuples we saw earlier.\n\n### Enumerate\n`enumerate` is a built in function that returns an iterator of tuples containing indices and values of a list. You'll often use this when you want the index along with each element of an iterable in a loop.\n```python\nletters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']\nfor i, letter in enumerate(letters):\n    print(i, letter)\n```\nThis code would output:\n```txt\n0 a\n1 b\n2 c\n3 d\n4 e\n```",

This example from earlier:\n```python\ncapitalized_cities = []\nfor city in cities:\n    capitalized_cities.append(city.title())\n```\ncan be reduced to:\n```python\ncapitalized_cities = [city.title() for city in cities]\n```\nList comprehensions allow us to create a list using a `for` loop in one step.\n\n\nYou create a list comprehension with brackets `[]`, including an expression to evaluate for each element in an iterable. This list comprehension above calls `city.title()` for each element `city` in `cities`, to create each element in the new list, `capitalized_cities`. \n\n### Conditionals in List Comprehensions\nYou can also add conditionals to list comprehensions (listcomps). After the iterable, you can use the `if` keyword to check a condition in each iteration.\n```python\nsquares = [x**2 for x in range(9) if x % 2 == 0]\n```\nThe code above sets `squares` equal to the list [0, 4, 16, 36, 64], as x to the power of 2 is only evaluated if x is even. If you want to add an `else`, you will get a syntax error doing this. \n```python\nsquares = [x**2 for x in range(9) if x % 2 == 0 else x + 3]\n```\nIf you would like to add `else`, you have to move the conditionals to the beginning of the listcomp, right after the expression, like this. \n```python\nsquares = [x**2 if x % 2 == 0 else x + 3 for x in range(9)]\n```\nList comprehensions are not found in other languages, but are very common in Python.\n",

We encourage you to give them a good try, but if you get stuck or need a hint, do not hesitate to look at the solutions. \n\nThe following questions are based on data on Oscar Award Nominations for Best Director between the years 1931 to 2010.  To start you off, we've provided a dictionary called \"nominated\" with the year (as key) and list of directors who were nominated in that year (as value). We've provided you with a different dictionary called \"winners\" with the year (as key) and list of directors who won the award in that year (as value). \n\n**Helpful hint:**\n\n1.  You may find it helpful to use a paper and pen  to think through the logic of the `for` loop instead of directly trying to type out your code. `for` loops are tricky, but if you take the time to slowly work out the question's logic, and write out what is happening with each iteration in the `for` loop, it's easier to think through the code.",

              "text": " Here are some possible solutions for these questions.\n\n## Question 1a\nProvide a dictionary with the count of nominations for each director.\n\n##### Here's the logic for my solution:\n1. To solve this question, I use the `.items` method for dictionaries. Remember, the key in our nominated dictionary is a list of nominated directors. Think Compound Data Structures! \n2. I know I need to create a dictionary where the key is a director and the value is the number of nominations. \n3. But to get each director as a key, I will have to use two `for` loops. \n4. First, to iterate through the `nominated` dictionary's value (which here is a list of nominations) .\n5.  But I have do to this again to iterate through each element (what I'm trying to get to - a nominated director) in the nominated list. \n6. After that, if the director isn't yet in our dictionary, we give that director a count of one. If the director is in the dictionary, we increment that director's count by one.\n\n```\nnom_count_dict = {}\nfor year, list_dir in nominated.items():\n    for director in list_dir:\n        if director not in nom_count_dict:\n            nom_count_dict[director] = 1\n        else:\n            nom_count_dict[director] += 1\n```\n## Question 1b\nProvide a dictionary with the count of wins for each director.\n\n##### Essentially, it is the same logic as above, with the other dictionary.\nWe could use the same approach as in question 1a and it would work fine, but I've provided a shorter alternative here. Instead of the last 4 lines as above, I've just written 1 line, by using the `.get` method. In this line, we find the director in the win_count_dict dictionary and return the value for that director (the number of times they've won). If they aren't in the dictionary, `get` returns 0 for that director. Then we increment that director's count by one.\n```\nwin_count_dict = {}\nfor year, winnerlist in winners.items():\n    for winner in winnerlist:\n        win_count_dict[winner] = win_count_dict.get(winner, 0) + 1\n```\n## Question 2\nProvide a list with the name(s) of the director(s) with the most Oscar wins.\n\n##### Here's the logic for my solution:\n- To address this question,  I will need to first create a dictionary with the number of wins by each winning director. For that I can use the code we wrote for Question 1b above.\n\n```\n#FIRST PART OF SOLUTION\nwin_count_dict = {}\nfor year, winnerlist in winners.items():\n    for winner in winnerlist:\n        win_count_dict[winner] = win_count_dict.get(winner, 0) + 1\n```\n\n2. This win_count_dict dictionary provides a dictionary with the win count for the directors. We will need this to then identify which key (here, director name) has the highest value (here, win count).\n3. To perform this task, we use a variable `highest_count` to keep track of the highest count of wins.\n4. We iterate through the dictionary to see if the value for a key (i.e., wins for a director) is more than the highest count. \n5. If it is, we replace that value as the `highest_count`. \n6. Plus we add that key (here, director name) to our list tracking the `most_win_director`.\n7. Every time we come upon a value higher than the current highest_count, we replace `highest_count` with the new higher value, empty the `most_win_director` and replace it with the new key (i.e., director's name).\n\n```\n#SECOND PART OF SOLUTION\nhighest_count = 0\nmost_win_director = []\n\nfor key, value in win_count_dict.items():\n    if value > highest_count:\n        highest_count = value\n        most_win_director.clear()\n        most_win_director.append(key)\n    elif value == highest_count:\n        most_win_director.append(key)\n    else:\n        continue\n```\n\n**Here is an alternative compact solution** to replace the 12 lines above for the second part of the solution, using the built-in function `max()`, and a list comprehension with a condition:\n\n```\n#ALTERNATIVE SECOND PART OF SOLUTION\nhighest_count = max(win_count_dict.values())\n\nmost_win_director = [key for key, value in win_count_dict.items() if value == highest_count]\n``` ",
