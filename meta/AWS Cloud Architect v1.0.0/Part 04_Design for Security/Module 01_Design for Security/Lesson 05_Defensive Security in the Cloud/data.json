Internal attackers may also have gained access to instances and hosts running in the cloud and will attempt to install and run malware or access data on cloud instances. \n\nThe threat is compounded if an attacker or a piece of malicious software has gained network access to other private networks that are connected to your cloud environment. To prevent this, it is critical that cloud hosts are hardened and set up to restrict access even if they are not public facing.\n\nThe AWS API can also become a target if attackers gain access to internal code repositories that mistakenly hold API keys and other secrets.\n\n### Identifying Threats and Vulnerabilities\n\nThe goal of this entire course is to design cloud architectures so that the likelihood of any of these types of attacks, both external and internal, are reduced or eliminated. \n\nIn previous lessons we looked at how to implement best practices around securing cloud networks, access to the API, and storing our data securely.

This is similar to our walkthrough earlier in the lesson. You will be writing a custom policy and showing that the terraform template does not pass. You will then remediate the code and try the scan again to verify that it passed.\n\n### Technology Requirements\n- You are recommended to use the same tool, [Regula](https://github.com/fugue/regula), that we used in the walkthrough, however, you can also investigate other tools which will accomplish the same goal.\n- You will need [Terraform installed locally](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) in the environment that you will perform this exercise.\n- You will also need [opa](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#1-download-opa) installed.\n\n### Steps\n1. Ensure that your local terraform environment is set up with a valid profile and region set to your AWS account and preferred region.\n\nCreate a simple terraform file with the below contents. Call it `iam_policy.tf`:\n\n```json\nresource \"aws_iam_policy\" \"policy\" {\n  name        = \"cand-c3-l4-e1-iam-policy\"\n  path          = \"/\"\n  description = \"a policy to test IAC scanning\"\n\n  policy = <<EOF\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Action\": [\n        \"*\"\n      ],\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Resource\": \"*\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nEOF\n}\n```\n\n2. Clone the [regula tool locally](https://github.com/fugue/regula).\n\n3. Spend a few minutes reading the regula tool README to get familiar with how it works.\n\n4. Run the regula tool from the root directory where you have cloned your repo:\n```bash\n./bin/regula ~/tf_test/ lib rules/aws/\n```\nReplace `~/tf_test/` with the path to the directory where you saved your `iam_policy.tf file`.\n\n5. Examine the outputs and notice which rule has failed. It should be the `iam_admin_policy` rule.\n\n6. Update the IAM policy in the `.tf` file so that it is more restrictive.  \nIn the statement change:\n```json\n     \"Action\": [\n        \"*\"\n      ],\n```\n\nTo:\n```json\n     \"Action\": [\n        \"s3:GetObject\"\n      ],\n```\n\n7. Run the regula command again.  All the checks should pass this time.",

We looked at identity and access management, network configuration, and ensuring data is protected.\n\nWe also looked at checking our infrastructure code for misconfigurations that could lead to vulnerabilities.  \n\nNow, regardless of how AWS services and resources are deployed and configured, be it via infrastructure as code, the console, CLI, or other methods,  once your resources are actually deployed and set up in AWS, it's critical to ensure that things have been configured with the security best practices that we outlined earlier.\n\nLets go over some AWS native and other tools to identify misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. AWS provides some native services that can be used to check your environment for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.\n\nThere are also a plethora of commercial and open source tools that will also provide visibility into the overall security configuration posture of your AWS environment.  Almost all of them also provide the ability of writing custom rules to allow you to test any custom security requirements that need to be met.",

Rules can be set up to evaluate on configuration change, or on a cron schedule.\n\nA basic example of a rule could be to identify any security group that allows RDP access from all IP addresses - or 0.0.0.0/0 port 3389.\n\nSince all rules are based on lambda functions, AWS provides the ability to create custom rules that evaluate a specific criteria which may not be available as a rule out of the box.  This also allows custom rules which can check compliance of resources outside the fold of AWS config. Results of AWS Config from multiple accounts can also be sent to a central AWS account for analysis.\n\n**It is strongly recommended to setup AWS Config rules for any security or compliance requirements that your organization has**.\n",

These types of checks will scan instances and containers for vulnerabilities and lack of best practices.\n\nExamples of these types of vulnerabilities include:\n- Allowing SSH password login\n- Vulnerabilities to Django libraries\n\nEnsuring that instances are launched from the latest image,  patched regularly and have basic security hardening will reduce the chance of vulnerabilities being found.\n\n#### AWS Inspector\nAWS inspector is intended to specifically analyze and report on vulnerabilities on EC2 instances.  \n\n##### Operating System Vulnerabilities\nAWS Inspector is designed to identify vulnerabilities at the OS level.\n\nOnce the inspector agent is installed on an instance, it can scan against:\n- CIS benchmarks for linux and windows\n- AWS security best practices\n- Common vulnerabilities and exposures or CVE findings\n\n##### Network Reachability\nInspector can also provide a report on network reachability from the public internet to instances and load balancers along with specific ports that are reachable.\n\n##### Limitations with AWS Inspector\nThe type of scanning that inspector provides is considered static scanning.\n\n**Static scanning** refers to a one time (or  scheduled) that will run and provide a set of findings.\n\n**Dynamic scanning**, on the other hand, is continuous monitoring that is designed to catch changes to configuration or other suspicious activity in real-time.  \n\nOutside of AWS, there are many many products and vendors that provide varying levels of OS vulnerability scanning.  Since this concept is not new to the cloud, many security teams opt to use existing products to achieve OS level vulnerability scanning.\n\n#### Vulnerabilities on Containers\n\nChecking container images for vulnerabilities can be done using a number of open source and commercial tools. \n\nOpen source tools include:\n- Clair\n- Anchore\n- Trivy\n- etc.\n\nCommercial products include: \n- aquasec, \n- sysdig\n- twistlock\n-  etc.\n\nCommercial products generally also provide dynamic container monitoring once containers are deployed and running.\n\n#### Disclaimer:\nPlease note that the landscape of vendors and products that provide security monitoring in the cloud changes by the day.  The tools mentioned here are simply mentioned as examples and not specific recommendations. \n",

Login to your AWS Account and Turn on Config Recording\n - Go to the AWS Config service page.\n - Follow the [instructions here to set up config recording](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/gs-console.html)\n - Check the **Choose Specific Resources** option to see all available AWS resource types that can be monitored with AWS Config. Select **S3 Buckets** for this exercise.\n - Please note down which S3 bucket you have used to store config logs.\n\n2. Set Up a Rule to Monitor S3 Bucket Encryption\n - Go to **Rules** and add a rule. On this page, you can browse through the many preconfigured rules that are available in AWS config.\n - In the search box, put \n\"S3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled\" and select the rule. \n - On the next page, leave all the defaults, and click save.\n\n3. Check Rule Compliance\n - Scroll through the list of rules until you find the rule that was added: `s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled`\n - You can see if the rule is in compliance or not. Click the rule name to see more details.\n - You can view details related to specific resources that are in compliance or out of compliance. \n - Choose a bucket that is not in compliance.  If there or no buckets in the list go ahead and create a new S3 bucket for this exercise that does not have default encryption enabled.\n - If you created a new bucket, verify that it has been evaluated and is now showing in the list.\n - Go to the bucket of choice and update the default encryption setting on the bucket.\n - Wait roughly 5 minutes for the change to trigger a rule check and check the config rule again. \n - Change the filter in the rule to show in compliance resources only.  You should see the bucket listed. \n - Click the bucket name to see further details. Click on the \"configuration timeline\".\n - You can see details of when the s3 bucket was changed.  Try to use this page to see what specifically changed in terms of the S3 configuration.\n\n4. Cleanup\n - Delete the rule and S3 bucket that you have created for this exercise.",

              "text": "### Security Event Sources in AWS\n\nSecurity information and event monitoring is a pillar of information security.\n\nAs you operationalize your workloads in the cloud it is critical that you have insight into activity and security events related to the cloud accounts and applications.\n\nThis type of security monitoring is important in order to:\n- Identify any anomalous or suspicious activity in cloud accounts, servers, networks, and applications\n- Provide traceability for forensics and root cause analysis.\n- Provide auditability for access to sensitive data or actions\n\n#### Event Sources Available in AWS\n\nLet's look at some of the event sources we should be looking at in AWS.\n\n##### CloudTrail\n\nAWS CloudTrail is the source of activity logging within an AWS account.  Any API activity, console usage, cross account access etc will be recorded in CloudTrail. CloudTrail will log all activity and allow you to search these logs for 90 days. \n\nHowever it is highly recommended to configure CloudTrail logs in all accounts and all regions to be written to S3 buckets, preferably a central S3 bucket in a dedicated security account. These logs can then be examined later or ingested by a log analysis or SIEM tool.\n\n**CloudTrail is by far the most valuable tool to monitor and audit activity in your AWS account**.  \n\n##### VPC Flow Logs\n\nWhen VPC flow logs provide insight into network activity including:\n- Connection attempts or rejects, allows or denies\n- Source and destination IPs, ports\n- Packets and byte counts\n\nIt is important to note that VPC flow logs do not provide visibility into actual traffic content or payload.\n\nIf you need visibility into network traffic content in order to perform more sophisticated detection of activity you can enable VPC traffic mirroring.  Once VPC traffic mirroring is enabled, you can ship this data to third party network monitoring tools.\n\nFor more details regarding network mirroring please [refer to AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/flow-log.html)\n\n##### S3 Bucket Logs\nAny changes to an S3 bucket's configuration will be logged as API calls in CloudTrail.\n\nFrom a security standpoint it is important to be aware of attempts to read or write objects to S3 buckets - especially those that contain sensitive or critical data. Object level logging is optional and can be enabled either through CloudTrail or the S3 bucket's settings.  All calls to read or write data will appear in CloudTrail.\n\n##### AWS Config logs\nConfig logs record all state changes for any resources that are being monitored by AWS Config. These logs should be sent to a log analysis tool to gain deeper visibility into configuration state changes.\n\n##### DNS logs\nDNS query logging is also available in AWS Route53. Regardless of your choice to enable DNS query logging, AWS does maintain these logs behind the scenes and will use them for identifying suspicious activity.\n\n##### EC2 Instance Server Logs\nSystem logs from your Linux and Windows instances are also critical to identifying suspicious activity or auditing. These logs can be sent to cloudwatch logs or other log analysis tools or products that provide intrusion detection and dynamic host based security event monitoring.",

Many cloud security monitoring and SIEM tools have out of the box features to look at cloud native logs such as CloudTrail and VPC flow logs and identify anomalous activity.  \n\nExample vendor tools include:\n- Splunk\n- Sumologic, \n- Lacework\n- CloudKnox\n- etc.\n\n### CloudWatch Alarms\nCloudTrail logs can be sent to CloudWatch logs and custom alarms can be set up to monitor specific CloudTrail event types. An example use case of this, is an admin being notified on concerning activity, such as modifications to security groups or a root user login to the AWS account.\n\n### Examining CloudTrail Logs and Watching for Events",

Ensure that you select default encryption.\n- Once the bucket is created, go back and remove the default encryption setting.\n\n### 2. Search CloudTrail Event History\n- After a few minutes, go to the CloudTrail service console and go to Event History.\n- Search for the login event by choosing \"Event Name\" in the first filter box and pasting the text ConsoleLogin into the second filter box.  You should not only see your login that you just performed but all logins in the last 90 days.\n- Expand the event to see more details.  Click View Event.\n\n#### 3. Expected Results\n- You should be able to see the IP address you logged in from, the user name, time, and other valuable details.\n- Search again, this time on the filter choose \"Resource Name\" and in the second box put the S3 bucket name that you just created.\n\n#### 4.

              "text": "### Web Application Firewalls in the Cloud\n\nThere are a few different ways of incorporating WAF protection to defend against application level exploits.\n\n#### Cloud-Based WAF product\n\nThere are many vendors, such as Akamai or Cloudflare, which web clients point to as an entry point into your application. These are designated as CDN providers, however they provide WAF capabilities as part of their offering.\n\nCloud providers such as AWS also provide this type of service natively.  AWS WAF can be placed in front of public facing application services such as CloudFront and API Gateway transparently so that application endpoints do not need to change.\n\n#### WAF appliance \n\nA WAF appliance or network based WAF can be deployed into a VPC to protect EC2 based application traffic. These can be costly and complex to implement and what you would typically find in a traditional data center environment.\n\nExample vendors include:\n- F5\n- Fortinet\n- Imperva \n- etc.\n\n#### Host-Based WAFs\n\nThese products attempt to provide similar defense but are deployed as part of a web applications server instance.  \n\n#### Serverless Security Tools\nServerless applications also need to be defended.  Many products offer capabilities to defend serverless applications from application exploits.\n\nExample products include: \n- Aqua\n- Twistlock\n- PureSec\n\n### WAF Best Practices\n\n#### 1. Test and Fine Tune WAF Rules\n\nSet up the WAF with identical configuration in lower environments for testing to ensure that your applications still work as expected in production.  Fine tuning may be required to rule out false positives.\n\n#### 2. Penetration Testing\nPerform penetration and exploit testing against applications to ensure that the WAF defends as expected.  Test both with and without the WAF to get a better understanding of defensive capabilities.\n\n#### 3. Logging\nEnable WAF logging and export logs to your security monitoring tools.\n\n#### 4. Discovery\nIdentify all public endpoints for your applications including CloudFront, Application Load Balancers, API Gateway.  If your application is exposed to the internet with other methods, consider moving your application behind these mentioned services.\n\nOnce identified, put together a plan to start defending your applications with a web application firewall.\n",
