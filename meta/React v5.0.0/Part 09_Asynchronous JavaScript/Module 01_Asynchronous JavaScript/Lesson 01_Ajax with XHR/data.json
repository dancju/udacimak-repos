The server creates and returns a page to the client. Finally, the client loads the new page and displays the information. If they interact with the page, say to add or remove something by submitting a form, they start the cycle all over again. The client will make another request, the server returns a totally new page, the client loads and presents it to the user again.\n\nUp until the mid 2000s, this was basically the only way internet communication occurred. Information would reside on the server, and a client would request that data and refresh the page and display it. This cycle would repeat for each and every new page request.\n\nIn the late 90s, the Microsoft Outlook team added the XMLHTTP component to Internet Explorer and built a web version of the Outlook mail client. This code was later picked up by other browsers as XMLHttpRequest. This allowed browsers to make HTTP requests from Javascript and update the current page in place without fetching an entire page from the server. Instead of the synchronous model of waiting for a whole page, the user interface could update asynchronously as the user kept working. Most of the data being exchanged used the XML format.\n\n### AJAX\n\nIn 2005, [Jesse James Garrett coined the term AJAX](https://web.archive.org/web/20080702075113/http://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/essays/archives/000385.php) to mean “Asynchronous Javascript and XML”.  This is essentially the technique of using [XMLHTTPRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) to fetch data and then modify the current page.\n\nAJAX took the web world by storm, spreading far beyond Microsoft Outlook. State-of-the-art web applications like Flickr, GMail, and Google Maps rapidly adopted it. Instead of having to wait for data and have the entire page refresh, these new, near instantaneous applications were incredible.\n\n### Browser Inconsistencies\n\nHold up, though. Ajax wasn't all ponies and rainbows. There were several different, incompatible browser implementations and developers were forced to code for one browser or write complex code for them all. Eventually, JavaScript libraries like jQuery and YUI emerged to reconcile the differences.\n\nAJAX apps were great, but difficult for individual developers to write; as browsers kept changing, and people demanded apps on more devices, the code then became more and more complex and confusing. This challenge led to the rise of standard Javascript frameworks and libraries. JavaScript libraries arose to hide the complex browser differences, JavaScript frameworks made developing  complex, powerful applications manageable.",

We do that with an `XMLHttpRequest` object. We can create these objects with the provided `XMLHttpRequest` constructor function. \n\nOne of the best ways to learn is to get your hands dirty and try things out! So go to [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), open up the developer tools, and run the following on the console:\n\n```js\nconst asyncRequestObject = new XMLHttpRequest();\n```\n\nConfusingly, the constructor function has \"XML\" in it, but it's not limited to only XML documents. Remember that the \"AJAX\" acronym used to stand for \"Asynchronous JavaScript and XML\". Since the main file format that was originally used for asynchronous data exchange were XML files, it's easy to see why the function is called `XMLHttpRequest`!\n\nXMLHttpRequests (commonly abbreviated as XHR or xhr) can be used to request any file type (e.g. plain text files, HTML files, JSON files, image files, etc.) or data from an API. \n        ",
