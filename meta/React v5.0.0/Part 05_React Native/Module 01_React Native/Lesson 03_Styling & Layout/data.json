              "text": "## CSS in JS\n\nBefore we jump into how CSS in JavaScript works, let's check out an example of some \"normal\" HTML and CSS:\n\n```html\n<!-- index.css -->\n.avatar {\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  margin: 10px;\n  width: 48px;\n  height: 48px;\n}\n\n<!-- // index.html -->\n<div>\n  <img class='avatar' src='https://tylermcginnis.com/tylermcginnis_glasses-300.png' />\n</div>\n```\nNothing too surprising! But since we're not using HTML or CSS files to build mobile apps -- how would this look in React Native? \n\nFirst, it's important to know that all of the core components in React Native can accept a prop named `style`. One way we can leverage this prop is to provide styling to components with inline JavaScript objects:\n\n```js\nfunction Avatar ({ src }) {\n  return (\n    <View>\n      <Image\n        style={{borderRadius: 5, margin: 10, width: 48, height: 48}}\n        source={{uri: 'https://tylermcginnis.com/tylermcginnis_glasses-300.png'}}\n      />\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `<Image>` component receives two props: `style` and `source`. The value of `style` is just a plain old JavaScript object with `borderRadius`, `margin`, `width`, and `height` properties. Keep in mind that unlike CSS on the web, properties are written in camelCase (i.e., `borderRadius` in CSS in JS, but `border-radius` on the web).\n\nThis works, but things can get muddy quickly. Imagine if the inline object contained a dozen properties, or if we wanted the same style to apply to more than just one component! One way to keep your code DRY and reusable is to store the object in a variable:\n\n```js\nconst styles = {\n  image: {\n    borderRadius: 5,\n    margin: 10,\n    width: 48,\n    height: 48\n  }\n};\n\nfunction Avatar ({ src }) {\n  return (\n    <View>\n      <Image\n        style={styles.image}\n        source={{uri: 'https://tylermcginnis.com/tylermcginnis_glasses-300.png'}}\n      />\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIt's a great way to clean things up a bit, but React Native goes a step further with its `StyleSheet` API. Check out the following example:\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';\n\nexport default class TextExample extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View>\n        <Text style={styles.greenLarge}>This is large green text!</Text>\n        <Text style={styles.red}>This is smaller red text!</Text>\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  greenLarge: {\n    color: 'green',\n    fontWeight: 'bold',\n    fontSize: 40\n  },\n  red: {\n    color: 'red',\n    padding: 30\n  },\n});\n```\n\nHere, an object containing styles is passed into `StyleSheet`'s `create` method. It looks similar to styling with a JavaScript object variable! However, using `StyleSheet` gives us a few benefits in terms of code quality and performance. We’ll take a closer look later in this Lesson as well, but this is how the React Native docs describe it:\n\n>Code quality\n>  * By moving styles away from the render function, you're making the code easier to understand.\n>  * Naming the styles is a good way to add meaning to the low-level components in the render function.\n>\n>Performance\n>  * Making a stylesheet from a style object makes it possible to refer to it by ID instead of creating a new style object every time.\n>  * It also allows to send the style only once through the bridge. All subsequent uses are going to refer to an id (not implemented yet).\n>\nAnother benefit is that `StyleSheet` validates the content within the style object as well. This means that should there be any errors in any properties or values in your style objects, the console will throw an error during compilation instead of at runtime.\n>\n> ## 💡 Additional Styling💡\n>\n> If you wanted to implement more than one style to a component, the `style` prop can accept styles as an array:\n>\n> ```js\n> <Text style={[styles.red, styles.greenLarge]}>This will be red, then greenLarge</Text>\n> ```\n>\n> The above `<Text>` component will render large green text, as the last style in the array will take precedence. This is a great way to inherit styles!\n",

There are many different styling libraries popping up and each has different tradeoffs. Two of the most popular are [Glamorous](https://github.com/robinpowered/glamorous-native) and [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components). The whole idea behind both of these libraries is that styling is a primary concern of the component, and therefore styling should be coupled with the component itself.

That's a joke.\n\nWhenever I learn a new technology, I like to answer the question, “Why does this specific technology exist?” With flexbox, the answer to this question may just be that creating an all-purpose layout with CSS can be quite cumbersome. The whole goal of flexbox is to create a more efficient way to \"lay out, align, and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic\". In a nutshell, flexbox is all about creating dynamic layouts.\n\nThe main idea of flexbox is that you give the parent element the ability to control the layout of all of their (_immediate_!) child elements rather than having each child element control its own layout. When you do this, the parent becomes a **flex container** while the child elements become **flex items**. An example of this is instead of having to float to the left all children of an element and add margin to each one, instead, you can just have the parent element specify to have all of its children be laid out in a row with even space between them. So, layout responsibilities move from the children to the parent. This allows for more fine tuned control over the layout of your app.\n",

That's because you can actually change which Axis is Main and which is Cross. That brings us to our first flexbox property, `flex-direction` (or `flexDirection` in React Native).\n\n`flex-direction` has two values:\n\n* `row`\n* `column`\n\nBy default, every element in React Native has the `flexDirection: column` declaration. When an element has a `flex-direction` of `column`, its _Main_ Axis is vertical and its _Cross_ Axis is horizontal, just as we saw in the image above. However, if you give an element a `flexDirection: row` declaration, the axes switch. The Main axis becomes horizontal, while the Cross axis becomes vertical. Again, this is crucial because your entire layout is dependent on these two axes.\n",

Let's dive into the different properties and values we can use to align child elements along these axes.\nLet's focus entirely on the _Main_ Axis, first. \n\nIn order to specify how children align themselves along the Main Axis, you'll use the `justifyContent` property. `justifyContent` has five different values you can use in order to change how the children align themselves along the Main Axis.\n\n* `flex-start`\n* `center`\n* `flex-end`\n* `space-around`\n* `space-between`\n\nWoah. I just dropped lots of unfamiliar terms. I'll walk through each and every one of them though, so we're good 💃🏽.\n\nIf you want to follow along (which I _highly_ recommend you do), create a new React Native project called \"FlexboxExamples\" and swap out your `App.js` code with the following:\n\n```js\nimport React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport { StyleSheet, Text, View, AppRegistry } from 'react-native'\n\nclass FlexboxExamples extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View style={styles.container}>\n        <View style={styles.box}/>\n        <View style={styles.box}/>\n        <View style={styles.box}/>\n      </View>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n  },\n  box: {\n    height: 50,\n    width: 50,\n    backgroundColor: '#e76e63',\n    margin: 10,\n  }\n})\n\nexport default FlexboxExamples;\n```\n\nNote that with the code above, the only thing we'll be changing is the styling in the `container` object in the `styles` StyleSheet object.

Notice in the box styling, I removed the `width: 50` because `flexDirection` is set to `column` by default meaning that flex items will be stretching horizontally (since we're using `alignItems`).\n\nTo cement this home, what will our UI look like if I change our styling to this?\n\n```js\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'stretch',\n    flexDirection: 'row',\n  },\n  box: {\n    width: 50,\n    backgroundColor: '#e76e63',\n    margin: 10,\n  }\n})\n```\n\nNotice I've changed the `flexDirection` to `row`, and I've added back in `width: 50` and removed the `height: 50`.\n",

              "text": "Let's break this down. First, the Main Axis is now running horizontally since we added `flexDirection: row`. This means that `alignItems` will be aligning the items along the _vertical_ axis. Because we've removed the height of the child elements and added `alignItems: stretch`, those elements are going to stretch along the vertical axis for the entire length of their parent component, which in this case is the whole view.\n\nUp until this point, we've only had one flex container or parent element. Don't get it twisted though; if you create more nested flex containers, the exact same logic above is going to be true for those child elements (flex items) but instead of being relative to the whole view (as in our example), they'll position themselves according to the their parent component. Your entire UI will be built upon nesting flex containers.\n\nAt this point, you're essentially a red belt in React Native styling TaeKwonDo. There are a few other flexbox features we need to look at, though.\n\nYou'll very quickly come to a realization that there are no percent-based styling in React Native. Though I agree it makes things a bit more difficult, everything you can do with percent-based styling you can do with flexbox. Remember the `flex: 1` declaration we used in all the examples above? That's the property that's going to allow us to do it. Interestingly enough there's no exact comparison for this feature in flexbox on the web, but it is similar to `flex-grow` if you know what that does.\n\nAs we've seen over and over, flexbox is concerned with giving control to the parent element to handle the layout of its children elements. The `flex` property is a bit different as it allows child elements to specify their height or width in comparison to their sibling elements. The best way to explain flex is to look at some examples.\n",

This basically says \"make sure that the middle sibling is twice as large along the Main Axis as the first and third children\". This is the reason why `flex` can replace percentages because usually a percent-based layout is just one where specific elements are relative to other elements, exactly like we're doing above. It's also important to note that if you place `flex: 1` on an element, that element is going to take up as much space as its parent takes up. That's why in most of our examples above because we want our \"layout area\" to be the size of the parent, which in our examples was the whole viewport.\n\nLet's go even deeper!",

To implement this, we'll need a way to have the child element override a specific positioning it received from its parent. Good news: that's exactly what `alignSelf` allows us to do! Notice it begins with _align_, so just like `alignItems`, it's going to position itself along the Cross Axis. It also has the exact same options as `alignItems` (`flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `stretch`).\n\nThe code to implement the image above is:\n\n```js\nclass FlexboxExamples extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View style={styles.container}>\n        <View style={styles.box}/>\n        <View style={[styles.box, {alignSelf: 'flex-end'}]}/>\n        <View style={styles.box}/>\n      </View>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    flexDirection: 'row',\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    alignItems: 'center',\n  },\n  box: {\n    width: 50,\n    height: 50,\n    backgroundColor: '#e76e63',\n    margin: 10,\n  }\n})\n\nexport default FlexboxExamples;\n```\n\nNote that all we've done is add `alignSelf: flex-end` to the second child element and that overrode what it was instructed to do by the parent (`alignItems: 'center'`).\n\nIf you've made it all the way through this, great work! I realize that was a lot to cover but I hope it's helped you get up and running with styling (and specifically flexbox) on React Native.\n",

This is primarily due to flexbox's ability to provide consistent layouts across different screen sizes. \n\nFlexbox containers comprise of two axes: a **main axis**, as well as a **cross axis**. Some of the more critical properties to consider when building layouts with flexbox include `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, and `align-items`. React Native's implementation of flexbox _is_ a bit different, however.

              "text": "## React Native's Flexbox Implementation\n\nReact Native implements flexbox for build layouts, but there are some key differences to keep in mind as you develop your applications. First, all containers in React Native are _flex containers_ by default. Recall that in traditional CSS flexbox, you would normally define a flex container like so:\n\n```css\n/*example.css*/\n\n.container {\n  display: flex;\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this is completely _unnecessary_ in React Native! By default, everything is `display: flex;`. You can just use the defaults as they are, without adding different properties or writing extra code.\n\nAnother important distinction is how React Native handles `flex-direction`, a property that establishes the main axis (i.e., defining the direction in which flex items are placed). In web applications, items default to `row`. But since we're working on mobile devices, React Native sets the default to `column`, which lays out items _vertically_.\n\nOne more major difference you'll encounter is how the `flex` property is used. On the web, `flex` specifies how a flex item grows or shrinks to manage the space around it (along the main axis). In React Native, `flex` is generally used with flex items that are on the same level, but hold different `flex` values. For example:\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { View } from 'react-native';\n\nconst FlexDemo = props => (\n  <View style={{flex: 1}}>\n    <View style={{flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'red'}} />\n    <View style={{flex: 2, backgroundColor: 'green'}} />\n    <View style={{flex: 3, backgroundColor: 'blue'}} />\n  </View>\n);\n\nexport default FlexDemo;\n```\n\nHere, `FlexDemo` is a stateless functional component which renders `<View>` components with different `flex` values. Its outermost container is set to `flex: 1`, which will expand the full available width along the main axis (i.e., the entire screen in this example). Its children `<View>` components will fill the space accordingly, rendering a `blue` background color that takes up three times as much space as `red` takes, and `green` that takes up exactly twice as much space as `red` takes.",

              "text": "## Styling: `Stylesheet` vs. Inline\n\nEarlier you were introduced to React Native’s `StyleSheet` API for creating “stylesheets” out of JavaScript objects. At first this approach may seem a little strange, but there are some reasons behind it. Primarily those reasons are code quality and performance. Let’s take a look at some comparisons in regards to code quality.\n\n```\n<View style={{\n  borderRadius: 4,\n  borderWidth: 0.5,\n  borderColor: '#d6d7da',\n}}>\n  <Text style={[\n    {fontSize: 19, fontWeight: 'bold'}, \n    props.isActive && { color: 'red' }\n  ]}>\n    Welcome\n  </Text>\n</View>\n\n```\n\nAbove we have some JSX for a pretty simple UI. Notice, that even though this UI is rather simple, the styling of it makes it rather messy. This is perhaps the biggest benefit to the StyleSheet API: by moving styles away from the render function, the code becomes easier to read and understand. Not only that, but _naming_ the styles is a good way to make components a little more declarative. With the `StyleSheet` API, we can change the code above to now look like this:\n\n```\nvar styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    borderRadius: 4,\n    borderWidth: 0.5,\n    borderColor: '#d6d7da',\n  },\n  title: {\n    fontSize: 19,\n    fontWeight: 'bold',\n  },\n  activeTitle: {\n    color: 'red',\n  },\n});\n\n<View style={styles.container}>\n  <Text style={[styles.title, props.isActive && styles.activeTitle]} />\n</View>\n\n```\n\n\nOn top of quality benefits, there are also performance benefits as well. Making a stylesheet from a style object makes it possible to refer to it by ID instead of creating a new style object every render.",

The reason for this is because, for the most part, you can design responsive grids with flexbox which will bypass the need to use media queries. In the rare case where flexbox just won’t work for your specific needs, you can use the [Dimensions](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/dimensions.html) API which we covered earlier to get similar results.",
