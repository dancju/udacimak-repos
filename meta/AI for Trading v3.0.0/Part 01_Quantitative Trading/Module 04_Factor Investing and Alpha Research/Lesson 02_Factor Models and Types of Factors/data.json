Risk factors are identified to control risk.  One way to do control an asset's exposure to a risk factor is to hold an equal amount long as short.  For instance, a dollar neutral portfolio with equal amounts long and short is controlling for risks that the overall market may move up or down.  \n\nIn general, factors that are significant in describing the mean of asset returns can be candidates for alpha factors.  Alpha factors are used to give some indication of whether each stock in the portfolio may have positive expected returns or negative expected returns.  For example, a former alpha factor was the market capitalization of a stock.  Small cap stocks tend to have higher future returns compared to large cap stocks.",

So risk factors as a whole account for more of the overall movement of stocks.  \n\nOn the other hand, alpha factors contribute to smaller movements of stocks, which is okay, because we seek to identify these alpha factors because they give some indication of the direction of expected returns, even if they're small compared to risk factors.  \n\nAn important reason why it's important to identify risk factors and then neutralize a portfolio's exposure to risk factors is that if we didn't, the asset movements due to risk factors would overwhelm the movements that are due to the alpha factors.",

One possible reason is that as other funds also discover the factor, and make investment decisions based on its signal, then the above-average gains or arbitrage opportunities get diffused as they're shared by a growing number of market participants.  Eventually, if a factor becomes very well known and most investors are acting on its signal, then the factor can be considered more of a risk factor.\n\nAmong quants, you may hear the joke that \"your alpha factor is my risk factor,\" since it's up to each fund to decide whether to use a factor to control risk or to drive returns.",
