In almost all cases, it is preferable to utilize functionality that already exists in the Standard Library, instead of implementing functionality from scratch. This is both because using the Standard Library is faster (it is [well-documented](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/)) and because many expert software engineers have worked on the Standard Library. The performance of Standard Library facilities is optimized, robust, and almost always as fast or faster than an initial re-implementation of the same functionality.\n\nIn fact, guideline [SL.1](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#sl1--use-libraries-wherever-possible) of the [C++ Core Guidelines](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines) is:\n> **Use libraries wherever possible**\n>\n> *Reason* Save time. Don’t re-invent the wheel. Don’t replicate the work of others. Benefit from other people’s work when they make improvements. Help other people when you make improvements.\n\nAnd guideline [SL.2](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#sl2-prefer-the-standard-library-to-other-libraries) is:\n> **Prefer the standard library to other libraries**\n>\n> *Reason* More people know the standard library. It is more likely to be stable, well-maintained, and widely available than your own code or most other libraries.\n\nWe use Standard Library features throughout the program, since proficiency with the Standard Library is a critical for C++ developers.\n\n## Namespace\nStandard Library functions and classes exist in the `std::` namespace. [`std::vector`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/), for example, refers to the `vector` class within the Standard Library. Typically, in order to use a Standard Library feature we must both include the necessary header file (e.g. `#include <vector>`) and also namespace the class with `std::` (e.g. `std::vector`).",

Each target performs a different action. \n\n`build` is a common target name that is configured in the `Makefile` to compile all of the project's source code into an executable file. `clean`, on the other hand, is a common target to delete all object files and other artifacts of the build process, resulting in a clean, unbuilt project state. \n\nRunning either `make build` or `make clean` (or any other target) on the command line would cause Make to search for a local Makefile, search for a matching target within that Makefile, and then execute the target.\n\n## CMake\n[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is a built tool that facilitates cross-platform builds, so that it is straightforward to build the same source code on Linux, macOS, Windows, or any other operating system.

Therefore, learning how to use a debugger is an important part of becoming a software developer 😬\n\n## Debuggers\n[Debuggers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger) are tools that allow you to pause the execution of your code in various locations, inspect the state of the program, and step through your code line-by-line. \n\n[GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) and [LLDB](https://lldb.llvm.org/) are two popular, open-source debuggers for C++. Integrating them into a code editor often makes debugging easier.\n\n## Visual Studio Code Debugging\nIn order to use Visual Studio Code's [debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) with C++ files, you must install the free [C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools).",
