We will loosely refer to this as client-side encryption.\n\n#### Server-Side or AWS Service native encryption\nAlternatively, have the AWS service handle the underlying encryption activities. We can refer to this broadly as server-side encryption.\n\n### Common Scenarios\nLet's look at a few common scenarios of persisting data in a cloud environment and see how the data is encrypted.  ",

The data is effectively useless to them unless of course they have permissions or access to the encryption keys.\n\n#### Cons \nThe code will have additional complexity of using SDK's and libraries required to perform cryptographic functions. Some additional understanding of encryption is also needed to do this effectively. There is always the potential of this additional functionality being inadvertently omitted from the code .\n\n### Server-Side Encryption\n\n#### Pros\nFor most use cases server-side encryption can be completely transparent to the developer or application code. So, from an implementation perspective, it is simpler and easier to use.\n\n#### Cons \nAnyone with read access permissions to the service in question will perform a read and be able to see the plain text data.\n\n### Best Practices\nAs a best practice it is highly advisable to leverage server-side encryption as a default deployment pattern for any AWS services being used to store data. \n\nThe decision to use client-side encryption in your applications may be made on a case-by-case basis for sensitive data or to meet any compliance requirements.",

              "text": "### S3 Bucket Server-Side Encryption\n \nAs discussed previously, client-side encryption allows the application to encrypt data prior to sending it to disk or other persistent cloud storage.\n\nIn many cases, client-side encryption may not be required. Regardless of the choice to use client-side encryption, as a best practice we want to ensure that any data stored in the cloud should at minimum make use of the cloud provider's server-side encryption capabilities.\n\nS3 buckets provisioned in AWS support a few different methods of ensuring your data is encrypted when physically being stored on disk.\n\n#### S3-Managed Keys\n\nWith this simple option, we can specify that any object written to S3 will be encrypted by S3 and the S3 service will manage the encryption keys behind the scenes. Because the key management aspect is transparent to the caller, this is the simplest and easiest option.  It is important to keep in mind that with this option anyone with read access permissions to the bucket and file. Anyone with read permission will be able to make calls to the service to retrieve the file unencrypted.\n\n#### AWS-Managed Master Keys\n\nIn this option, the caller will need to specify that KMS will manage encryption keys for the S3 service. This provides additional auditability of S3's use of the encryption keys.\n\n#### Customer-Managed Master Keys\n\nAgain, the caller will need to specify that KMS will manage encryption keys for the S3 service. The caller will also need to specify the key that will be used for encryption.\nAdditionally, the caller needs to have permissions to use the key.  This provides additional ability to control and restrict which principals can access or decrypt sensitive data.\n\n#### Customer-Provided Keys\n\nIn this case, the customer can provide encryption keys to S3. S3 will perform the encryption on the server without keeping the key itself. The key would then be provided with the request to decrypt the object. With this option the burden of managing the key falls on the customer. ",

KMS provides multiple avenues for creating CMKs. It is important to understand the difference between these options. \n\n### AWS-Managed Customer Master Keys\nThis is the default and easiest type of KMS key to use. It requires very little management and no cost on the part of the customer.\n\nThe key is provisioned automatically by KMS when a service such as S3 or EC2 needs to use KMS to encrypt underlying data.  A separate master key would be created for each service that starts using KMS.\n\nPermissions to AWS managed keys are also handled behind the scenes.  Any principal or user who has access to a particular service would inherently have access to any encrypted data that the service had encrypted using the AWS managed keys.\n\nUsing an example of a DynamoDB table that has encryption using AWS managed keys, all users or roles in the account that have read access to the dynamodb table would be able to read data from the table.\n\nWith this method key rotation is also handled behind the scenes by AWS and keys are rotated every 3 years.\n\nThis approach is acceptable if **the sole requirement is to ensure that data is encrypted at rest in AWS' data centers**.\n\n#### Limitations With AWS Managed CMKs\nThe main drawback here is that it does not allow granular and least privileged access to the keys.  It would not be possible to segment and isolate permissions to certain keys and encrypted data. In addition to this limitation, AWS managed keys are not available for applications to use for client-side encryption since they are only available for use by AWS services.\n\nThis approach is also not recommended for accounts where sensitive data is present since in the event of the AWS account or role compromised for some reason, encrypted data may not be protected.",

In this case the user creates and manages permissions to the keys.  \n\nAWS will create the key material and rotate keys on a yearly basis, and the user does have the option to choose to manually rotate keys.\n\nThe main benefit to this approach is that **permissions to manage and use the keys can be explicitly defined and controlled**.  This allows separation of duties, segmentation of key usage etc.  \n\nAgain using DynamoDB as an example, we can have much more flexibility to restrict access to data by restricting access to encryption keys. For example we can have 2 separate master keys, for two different sets of tables or data classifications, for example non-sensitive and sensitive tables.  We can also assign certain IAM roles to be able to use the keys, and other IAM roles to be able to manage the keys.\n\nThis second approach is a good balance between manageability and security, and it will generally provide the capabilities mandated by most compliance standards.\n\nKMS also provides the ability for the user to create master key material outside of AWS and import it into KMS.\n\n#### Bring Your Own Key\nWhen new customer master keys are provisioned in KMS, by default, KMS creates and maintains the key material for you. However,  KMS also provides the customer the option of importing their own key material which may be maintained in a key store external to KMS. With this option **the customer has full control of the key's lifecycle including expiration, deletion, and rotation**.\n\nA potential use case for importing key material may be to maintain backup copies of the key material external to AWS to fulfill disaster recovery requirements. Customers may also find this option useful if they have a desire to use one key management system for cloud and on-premise infrastructure.",

              "text": "### Best Practices for Managing Customer Master Keys (CMKs)\n\n#### 1. Use Key Policies\n\nUse Key Policies to Explicitly Restrict the Following, Where Possible:\n- Allow certain IAM roles to manage keys.\n- Enforce the precense of MFA for management actions such as changing the key policy or deleting keys.\n- Allow certain IAM roles or users to use the keys for encryption, such as decryption or encryption.\n- Restrict specific AWS services to be allowed to use the key.  For example we can restrict a key to be only used for decrypting S3 objects by application ABC however application will not be able perform decryption actions on DynamoDB.\n\n##### The Default Key Policy\n\nWhen a key is created, the default key policy will allow the following:\n- Ability for IAM principals to be assigned privileges to manage the key. \n- Ability for select IAM principals to manage a key.\n- Ability for select IAM principals to use the key for cryptographic operations.\n- Ability for certain IAM principals to grant permissions to AWS services to use the key.\n\nIn most cases, the default key policy is sufficient with slight modifications depending on the need for other IAM users or accounts to be able to make use of the keys.\n\n#### 2. Least Privilege IAM Policies\n\nWhen using IAM policies to allow access to KMS keys, continue to apply the principle of least privilege wherein the policy only grants specific least required actions to a specific set of key resources.\n\n#### 3. Monitoring and Auditing\n\nAudit and Monitor Calls to KMS and Events Related to Customer Master Keys  \nUsing monitoring services such as CloudTrail and CloudWatch you can be aware of events generated by the KMS service related to management and usage.  Examples of this would be being notified of a keys scheduled deletion or auditing key usage.\n\n#### 4. Enforcing Encryption\n\nIn some cases it will be required to have safe-guards in place to prevent a situation where data can be stored without encryption.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to ensure that this does not happen:\n\n##### IAM Policies\n\nConfigure user or role IAM policies that contain policy conditions that will only allow the creation of a resource if it is set to use encryption.\n\n##### Resource Policies\n\nUsing resource policies, for example in S3, S3 buckets can be set up with bucket policies only allowing write of objects with server-side encryption enabled.\n\n##### Real-Time Monitoring and Remediation\n\nUsing real-time monitoring, lambda functions or AWS config can be used to immediately identify resources that have been created without the mandated encryption settings.\n\nTake this a step further and trigger automation to remove, disable, or update encryption settings on those resources.\n\n### Encryption Key Demo",

              "text": "## Exercise: Encryption Key Management\n\nIn this exercise, you will perform some steps which are similar to what we have demonstrated in the walkthrough to create, manage, and test encryption keys with a sample application.\n\n1. To get started, please login to your AWS account with a user or role that has administrator level privileges. \n\n2.  Create 2 new IAM roles for use with our sample application. \n - Name the first role `cand-c3-l3-ex2-write`\n - Assign the managed policy, `AWSLambdaExecute` and `AmazonS3FullAccess` to the role. \n - This will allow the lambda function to execute and to read and write files to any S3 buckets in your account.\n\n- Name the second role `cand-c3-l3-ex2-read`\n- Assign the managed policy, `AWSLambdaExecute` and `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` to the role. \n - This will allow the lambda function to execute and to read files from any S3 buckets in your account.\n\n - Note down the role names if you used other names.\n\n3. Create a new KMS key for this exercise; suggested name is `cand-c3-l3-ex2-key`. Choose the IAM user or role you are currently using from the list of principals allowed to administer the key.  Select the option that allows the key admin to delete the key.\n\n4. Choose only the first role, `cand-c3-l3-ex2-write`, as the IAM role allowed to use the key. Note down the key ARN.\n\n5. Create a new S3 bucket for this exercise that will be used to write files to. Note down the name of the bucket.\n\n6. Create a lambda function using the below sample code. The lambda function will write a file to s3 using server-side encryption. Call the lambda function `cand-c3-l3-ex2-lambda-write`.\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport boto3\nimport os\n\ns3 = boto3.client('s3')\n\ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\n        return s3.put_object(\n            Bucket=os.environ['S3_BUCKET'], \n            Key=\"cand_c3_l3_test_object_encrypted.txt\", \n            Body=bytes(\"file contents of my file\", 'utf-8'),\n            ServerSideEncryption=\"aws:kms\",\n            SSEKMSKeyId=os.environ['KEY_ARN']\n        )\n```\n\n7. Create two environment variables \n - `S3_BUCKET=`the name of the S3 bucket you created\n - `KEY_ARN=`the key ARN of the KMS key you created\n\n8. Assign the lambda function the role you created: `cand-c3-l3-ex2-write`.\n\n9. Create a second lambda function with the below sample code that will simply read a file and output its contents to a log. Call the lambda function `cand-c3-l3-ex2-lambda-read`.\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport boto3\nimport os\n\ns3 = boto3.client('s3')\n\ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\n        response =  s3.get_object(\n            Bucket=os.environ['S3_BUCKET'], \n            Key=\"cand_c3_l3_test_object_encrypted.txt\", \n\n        )\n        print(response['Body'].read())\n        \n        return\n```\n\n\n\n10. It will need one environment variable:\n - `S3_BUCKET=` the name of the S3 bucket you created\n\n11. Assign the lambda function the role you created: `cand-c3-l3-ex2-read`\n\n12. Call the `cand-c3-l3-ex2-lambda-write` lambda function using the \"Test\" button.  Our application does not process the event payload, however you can pass in below test event:\n```json\n{\n  \"key1\": \"value1\"\n}\n```\n13. The log output should indicate that the file was created successfully.  You can verify this by going to the S3 bucket in the console and seeing the file present.  In the properties for the file, verify that it has server-side encryption using the key that we created.\n\n14. Call the second lambda function, `cand-c3-l3-ex2-lambda-read`, using the \"Test\" button.  Our application does not process the event payload, however you can pass in below test event:\n```json\n{\n  \"key1\": \"value1\"\n}\n```\n\n You should receive an error indicating that the function was denied access to read the file. This is because the KMS key policy did not allow the second role permissions to use the key.\n See example output below:\n```bash\nSTART RequestId: 2427ad7b-e5b2-4e59-b377-5d2a7a453218 Version: $LATEST\n[ERROR] ClientError: An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the GetObject operation: Access Denied\n...\n```\n\n\n15. Update the key policy so that the second role, `cand-c3-l3-ex2-read`, can also use the key.\n\n16. Try running the second lambda function for reading the file. If the key policy was correctly updated, you should receive log output indicating a successful read.\n\n```bash\nSTART RequestId: afdfe861-a07f-4fb8-8c03-6fd1d09caf1c Version: $LATEST\nb'file contents of my file'\nEND RequestId: afdfe861-a07f-4fb8-8c03-6fd1d09caf1c\nREPORT RequestId: afdfe861-a07f-4fb8-8c03-6fd1d09caf1c\tDuration: 382.80 ms\tBilled Duration: 400 ms\tMemory Size: 128 MB\tMax Memory Used: 74 MB\tInit Duration: 412.23 ms\n```",

The SDK makes the process of using the AWS key management service seamless.\n\n#### Key Management Service (KMS)\nAWS service that allows provisioning, storage and management of master encryption keys. KMS also provides the ability to manage permissions pertaining to cryptographic actions on encryption keys.\n\n#### Client-Side Encryption\nWith client-side encryption, the application code will handle cryptographic operations on the data prior to persisting to a given storage medium.\n\n#### Server-Side Encryption\nWith server-side encryption, the storage service being used will handle cryptographic operations on the data while handling read and write operations. This process is transparent to the application which persists the data.\n\n#### Key Management Service (KMS)\nAWS service that allows provisioning, storage and management of master encryption keys. KMS also provides the ability to manage permissions pertaining to cryptographic actions on encryption keys.\n\n#### Customer Master Key (CMK)\nThe customer master key is the master encryption key that will be used to encrypt and store underlying data encryption keys in the KMS service. Other services or applications will select a CMK to use for their cryptographic operations.\n\n#### AWS-Managed CMK\nAWS-managed customer master keys are provisioned, rotated and managed by AWS.  AWS will provision a new master key for each AWS service in the AWS account at the time the service needs to start encrypting data.  These keys are not available to use by your applications for client-side encryption.\nYou may not change or assign permissions on these keys. \n\n#### Customer-Managed CMK\nCustomer-managed master keys are provisioned and managed by the customer (you).  Once you provision a key, you may use that key with any AWS services or applications.\n\nYou can manage permissions on customer managed CMKs to control which IAM users or roles can manage or use the encryption keys.  Permissions to use the keys can also be granted to AWS services and other AWS accounts.\n\n#### Default Encryption\nA configuration setting on an AWS resource, such as an S3 bucket, designating that the storage as a whole, or all objects written, will be encrypted by the service being used (e.g. S3).\n\n#### Key Rotation\nThe process of changing data encryption keys used for cryptographic operations on a periodic basis.",
