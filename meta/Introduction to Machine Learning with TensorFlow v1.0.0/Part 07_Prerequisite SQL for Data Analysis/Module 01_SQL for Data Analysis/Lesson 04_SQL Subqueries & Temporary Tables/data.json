Table Expressions\n3. Persistent Derived Tables\n\n___\n\nBoth **subqueries** and **table expressions** are methods for being able to write a query that creates a table, and then write a query that interacts with this newly created table.  Sometimes the question you are trying to answer doesn't have an answer when working directly with existing tables in database.  \n\nHowever, if we were able to create new tables from the existing tables, we know we could query these new tables to answer our question.  This is where the queries of this lesson come to the rescue.  \n\nIf you can't yet think of a question that might require such a query, don't worry because you are about to see a whole bunch of them!",

Then ordering by the number of events (the third column) gave us a quick way to answer the first question.\n```\nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,\n       channel, COUNT(*) as events\nFROM web_events\nGROUP BY 1,2\nORDER BY 3 DESC;\n```\n2.   Here you can see that to get the entire table in question 1 back,  we included an `*` in our **SELECT** statement.  You will need to be sure to alias your table.  \n```\nSELECT *\nFROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,\n                channel, COUNT(*) as events\n          FROM web_events \n          GROUP BY 1,2\n          ORDER BY 3 DESC) sub;\n```\n3. Finally, here we are able to get a table that shows the average number of events a day for each channel.  \n```\nSELECT channel, AVG(events) AS average_events\nFROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,\n                channel, COUNT(*) as events\n         FROM web_events \n         GROUP BY 1,2) sub\nGROUP BY channel\nORDER BY 2 DESC;\n```\n",

              "text": "# Subquery Formatting \n\nWhen writing **Subqueries**, it is easy for your query to look incredibly complex.  In order to assist your reader, which is often just yourself at a future date, formatting SQL will help with understanding your code.  \n\nThe important thing to remember when using subqueries is to provide some way for the reader to easily determine which parts of the query will be executed together. Most people do this by indenting the subquery in some way - you saw this with the solution blocks in the previous concept.  \n\nThe examples in this class are indented quite far—all the way to the parentheses. This isn’t practical if you nest many subqueries, but in general, be thinking about how to write your queries in a readable way.  Examples of the same query written multiple different ways is provided below.  You will see that some are much easier to read than others.\n_____\n### Badly Formatted Queries\n\nThough these poorly formatted examples will execute the same way as the well formatted examples, they just aren't very friendly for understanding what is happening!\n\nHere is the first, where it is impossible to decipher what is going on:\n\n```\nSELECT * FROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day, channel, COUNT(*) as events FROM web_events GROUP BY 1,2 ORDER BY 3 DESC) sub;\n```\nThis second version, which includes some helpful line breaks, is easier to read than that previous version, but it is still not as easy to read as the queries in the **Well Formatted Query** section.\n```\nSELECT *\nFROM (\nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,\nchannel, COUNT(*) as events\nFROM web_events \nGROUP BY 1,2\nORDER BY 3 DESC) sub;\n```\n\n_____\n### Well Formatted Query\n\nNow for a well formatted example, you can see the table we are pulling from much easier than in the previous queries.  \n\n```\nSELECT *\nFROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,\n                channel, COUNT(*) as events\n      FROM web_events \n      GROUP BY 1,2\n      ORDER BY 3 DESC) sub;\n```\n\nAdditionally, if we have a **GROUP BY**, **ORDER BY**, **WHERE**, **HAVING**, or any other statement following our subquery, we would then indent it at the same level as our outer query.\n\nThe query below is similar to the above, but it is applying additional statements to the outer query, so you can see there are **GROUP BY** and **ORDER BY** statements used on the output are not tabbed. The inner query **GROUP BY** and **ORDER BY** statements are indented to match the inner table.\n\n```\nSELECT *\nFROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,\n                channel, COUNT(*) as events\n      FROM web_events \n      GROUP BY 1,2\n      ORDER BY 3 DESC) sub\nGROUP BY day, channel, events\nORDER BY 2 DESC;\n```\nThese final two queries are so much easier to read!\n\n",

If we returned an entire column **IN** would need to be used to perform a logical argument.  If we are returning an entire table, then we must use an **ALIAS** for the table, and perform additional logic on the entire table.  ",

Provide the **name** of the **sales_rep** in each **region** with the largest amount of **total_amt_usd** sales.<br><br>\nFirst, I wanted to find the **total_amt_usd** totals associated with each **sales rep**, and I also wanted the region in which they were located.  The query below provided this information.\n```\nSELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt\nFROM sales_reps s\nJOIN accounts a\nON a.sales_rep_id = s.id\nJOIN orders o\nON o.account_id = a.id\nJOIN region r\nON r.id = s.region_id\nGROUP BY 1,2\nORDER BY 3 DESC;\n```\nNext, I pulled the max for each region, and then we can use this to pull those rows in our final result.\n```\nSELECT region_name, MAX(total_amt) total_amt\n        FROM(SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt\n                FROM sales_reps s\n                JOIN accounts a\n                ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id\n                JOIN orders o\n                ON o.account_id = a.id\n                JOIN region r\n                ON r.id = s.region_id\n                GROUP BY 1, 2) t1\n        GROUP BY 1;\n```\nEssentially, this is a **JOIN** of these two tables, where the region and amount match.\n```\nSELECT t3.rep_name, t3.region_name, t3.total_amt\nFROM(SELECT region_name, MAX(total_amt) total_amt\n        FROM(SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt\n                FROM sales_reps s\n                JOIN accounts a\n                ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id\n                JOIN orders o\n                ON o.account_id = a.id\n                JOIN region r\n                ON r.id = s.region_id\n                GROUP BY 1, 2) t1\n        GROUP BY 1) t2\nJOIN (SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt\n        FROM sales_reps s\n        JOIN accounts a\n        ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id\n        JOIN orders o\n        ON o.account_id = a.id\n        JOIN region r\n        ON r.id = s.region_id\n        GROUP BY 1,2\n        ORDER BY 3 DESC) t3\nON t3.region_name = t2.region_name AND t3.total_amt = t2.total_amt;\n```\n2. For the region with the largest sales **total_amt_usd**, how many **total** orders were placed? <br><br>\nThe first query I wrote was to pull the **total_amt_usd** for each **region**.  \n```\nSELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt\nFROM sales_reps s\nJOIN accounts a\nON a.sales_rep_id = s.id\nJOIN orders o\nON o.account_id = a.id\nJOIN region r\nON r.id = s.region_id\nGROUP BY r.name;\n```\nThen we just want the region with the max amount from this table.  There are two ways I considered getting this amount.  One was to pull the max using a subquery.  Another way is to order descending and just pull the top value.  \n```\nSELECT MAX(total_amt)\nFROM (SELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt\n                FROM sales_reps s\n                JOIN accounts a\n                ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id\n                JOIN orders o\n                ON o.account_id = a.id\n                JOIN region r\n                ON r.id = s.region_id\n                GROUP BY r.name) sub;\n```\nFinally, we want to pull the total orders for the region with this amount:\n```\nSELECT r.name, COUNT(o.total) total_orders\nFROM sales_reps s\nJOIN accounts a\nON a.sales_rep_id = s.id\nJOIN orders o\nON o.account_id = a.id\nJOIN region r\nON r.id = s.region_id\nGROUP BY r.name\nHAVING SUM(o.total_amt_usd) = (\n         SELECT MAX(total_amt)\n         FROM (SELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt\n                 FROM sales_reps s\n                 JOIN accounts a\n                 ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id\n                 JOIN orders o\n                 ON o.account_id = a.id\n                 JOIN region r\n                 ON r.id = s.region_id\n                 GROUP BY r.name) sub);\n```\nThis provides the **Northeast** with **2357** orders.<br><br>\n3. **How many accounts** had more **total** purchases than the account **name** which has bought the most **standard_qty** paper throughout their lifetime as a customer? <br><br>\nFirst, we want to find the account that had the most **standard_qty** paper.  The query here pulls that account, as well as the total amount:\n```\nSELECT a.name account_name, SUM(o.standard_qty) total_std, SUM(o.total) total\nFROM accounts a\nJOIN orders o\nON o.account_id = a.id\nGROUP BY 1\nORDER BY 2 DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\nNow, I want to use this to pull all the accounts with more total sales:\n```\nSELECT a.name\nFROM orders o\nJOIN accounts a\nON a.id = o.account_id\nGROUP BY 1\nHAVING SUM(o.total) > (SELECT total \n                      FROM (SELECT a.name act_name, SUM(o.standard_qty) tot_std, SUM(o.total) total\n                            FROM accounts a\n                            JOIN orders o\n                            ON o.account_id = a.id\n                            GROUP BY 1\n                            ORDER BY 2 DESC\n                            LIMIT 1) sub);\n```\nThis is now a list of all the accounts with more total orders.  We can get the count with just another simple subquery.\n```\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM (SELECT a.name\n          FROM orders o\n          JOIN accounts a\n          ON a.id = o.account_id\n          GROUP BY 1\n          HAVING SUM(o.total) > (SELECT total \n                      FROM (SELECT a.name act_name, SUM(o.standard_qty) tot_std, SUM(o.total) total\n                            FROM accounts a\n                            JOIN orders o\n                            ON o.account_id = a.id\n                            GROUP BY 1\n                            ORDER BY 2 DESC\n                            LIMIT 1) inner_tab)\n                ) counter_tab;\n```\n\n4. For the customer that spent the most (in total over their lifetime as a customer) **total_amt_usd**, how many **web_events** did they have for each channel?<br><br>\nHere, we first want to pull the customer with the most spent in lifetime value.\n```\nSELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent\nFROM orders o\nJOIN accounts a\nON a.id = o.account_id\nGROUP BY a.id, a.name\nORDER BY 3 DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\nNow, we want to look at the number of events on each channel this company had, which we can match with just the **id**.\n```\nSELECT a.name, w.channel, COUNT(*)\nFROM accounts a\nJOIN web_events w\nON a.id = w.account_id AND a.id =  (SELECT id\n                        FROM (SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent\n                              FROM orders o\n                              JOIN accounts a\n                              ON a.id = o.account_id\n                              GROUP BY a.id, a.name\n                              ORDER BY 3 DESC\n                              LIMIT 1) inner_table)\nGROUP BY 1, 2\nORDER BY 3 DESC;\n```\nI added an **ORDER BY** for no real reason, and the account name to assure I was only pulling from one account.<br><br>\n5. What is the lifetime average amount spent in terms of **total_amt_usd** for the top 10 total spending **accounts**?<br><br>\nFirst, we just want to find the top 10 accounts in terms of highest **total_amt_usd**.\n```\nSELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent\nFROM orders o\nJOIN accounts a\nON a.id = o.account_id\nGROUP BY a.id, a.name\nORDER BY 3 DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n```\nNow, we just want the average of these 10 amounts.\n```\nSELECT AVG(tot_spent)\nFROM (SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent\n         FROM orders o\n         JOIN accounts a\n         ON a.id = o.account_id\n         GROUP BY a.id, a.name\n         ORDER BY 3 DESC\n          LIMIT 10) temp;\n```\n<br>\n6. What is the lifetime average amount spent in terms of **total_amt_usd**, including only the companies that spent more per order, on average, than the average of all orders.<br><br>\nFirst, we want to pull the average of all accounts in terms of **total_amt_usd**:\n```\nSELECT AVG(o.total_amt_usd) avg_all\nFROM orders o\n```\nThen, we want to only pull the accounts with more than this average amount.  \n```\nSELECT o.account_id, AVG(o.total_amt_usd)\nFROM orders o\nGROUP BY 1\nHAVING AVG(o.total_amt_usd) > (SELECT AVG(o.total_amt_usd) avg_all\n                                  FROM orders o);\n```\nFinally, we just want the average of these values.  \n```\nSELECT AVG(avg_amt)\nFROM (SELECT o.account_id, AVG(o.total_amt_usd) avg_amt\n       FROM orders o\n       GROUP BY 1\n       HAVING AVG(o.total_amt_usd) > (SELECT AVG(o.total_amt_usd) avg_all\n                                      FROM orders o)) temp_table;\n```\n\n### Wow!

Notice, we are aliasing the table as `events` below:\n\n```\nWITH events AS (\n          SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day, \n                        channel, COUNT(*) as events\n          FROM web_events \n          GROUP BY 1,2)\n```\n\nNow, we can use this newly created `events` table as if it is any other table in our database:\n\n```\nWITH events AS (\n          SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day, \n                        channel, COUNT(*) as events\n          FROM web_events \n          GROUP BY 1,2)\n\nSELECT channel, AVG(events) AS average_events\nFROM events\nGROUP BY channel\nORDER BY 2 DESC;\n```\n______\n\nFor the above example, we don't need anymore than the one additional table, but imagine we needed to create a second table to pull from.  We can create an additional table to pull from in the following way:\n\n```\nWITH table1 AS (\n          SELECT *\n          FROM web_events),\n\n     table2 AS (\n          SELECT *\n          FROM accounts)\n\n\nSELECT *\nFROM table1\nJOIN table2\nON table1.account_id = table2.id;\n```\nYou can add more and more tables using the **WITH** statement in the same way.  The quiz at the bottom will assure you are catching all of the necessary components of these new queries.\n\nFeel free to explore how this works with the environment below.\n",

Arguably, the advanced features of **Subqueries** and **CTEs** are the most widely used in an analytics role within a company.  Being able to break a problem down into the necessary tables and finding a solution using the resulting table is very useful in practice. \n\nIf you didn't get the solutions to these queries on the first pass, don't be afraid to come back another time and give them another try.  Additionally, you might try coming up with some questions of your own to see if you can find the solution.  \n\nThe remaining portions of this course may be key to certain analytics roles, but you have now covered all of the main SQL topics you are likely to use on a day to day basis.
