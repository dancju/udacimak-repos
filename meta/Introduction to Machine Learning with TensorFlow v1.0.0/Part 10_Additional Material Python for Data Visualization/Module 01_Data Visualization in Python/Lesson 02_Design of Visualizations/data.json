              "text": "## The Four Levels of Measurement\n\nIn order to choose an appropriate plot type or method of analysis for your data, you need to understand the types of data you have. One common method divides the data into four **levels of measurement**:\n\n#### **Qualitative** or categorical types (non-numeric types)\n- **1. Nominal data**: pure labels without inherent order (no label is intrinsically greater or less than any other)\n- **2. Ordinal data**: labels with an intrinsic order or ranking (comparison operations can be made between values, but the magnitude of differences are not be well-defined)\n\n#### **Quantitative** or numeric types\n- **3. Interval data**: numeric values where absolute differences are meaningful (addition and subtraction operations can be made)\n- **4. Ratio data**: numeric values where relative differences are meaningful (multiplication and division operations can be made)\n\nAll quantitative-type variables also come in one of two varieties: **discrete** and **continuous**.\n- **Discrete** quantitative variables can only take on a specific set values at some maximum level of precision.\n- **Continuous** quantitative variables can (hypothetically) take on values to any level of precision.\n\nDistinguishing between continuous and discrete can be a little tricky – a rule of thumb is if there are few levels, and values can't be subdivided into further units, then it's discrete. Otherwise, it's continuous. If you have a scale that can only take natural number values between 1 and 5, that's discrete. A quantity that can be measured to two digits, e.g. 2.72, is best characterized as continuous, since we might hypothetically be able to measure to even more digits, e.g. 2.718. A tricky case like test scores measured between 0 and 100 can only be divided down to single integers, making it initially seem discrete. But since there are so many values, such a feature is usually considered as continuous.\n\nWhen exploring your data, the most important thing to consider first is whether your data is qualitative or quantitative. In later lessons, you will see how this distinction impacts your choice of plots.",

              "text": "# Recap of Previous Video\n\nThe table below summarizes our data types.  To expand on the information in the table, you can look through the text that follows.\n\n\n  | **Data Types**  |   | | \n|---|---|---|\n|  **Quantitative:** | **Continuous**  | **Discrete**  | \n|   | Height, Age, Income   | Pages in a Book,  Trees in Yard, Dogs at a Coffee Shop  |\n|   |   |   | \n| **Categorical:**  | **Ordinal**  |  **Nominal** | \n|   | Letter Grade,  Survey Rating  | Gender, Marital Status, Breakfast Items  | \n\nBelow is a little more detail of the information shared in the above table.\n\n# Another Look\n\nTo break down our data types, there are two main blocks:\n\n**Quantitative** and **Categorical**\n\n**Quantitative** can be further divided into `Continuous` or `Discrete`.\n\n**Categorical** data can be divided into `Ordinal` or `Nominal`.  \n\nYou should have now mastered what types of data in the world around us falls into each of these four buckets: Discrete, Continuous, Nominal, and Ordinal.  In the next sections, we will work through the numeric summaries that relate specifically to quantitative variables. \n\n________\n\n# Quantitative vs. Categorical\n\nSome of these can be a bit tricky - notice even though zip codes are a number, they aren’t really a quantitative variable.  If we add two zip codes together, we do not obtain any useful information from this new value.  Therefore, this is a categorical variable.   \n\n**Height**, **Age**, the **Number of Pages in a Book** and **Annual Income** all take on values that we can add, subtract and perform other operations with to gain useful insight.  Hence, these are `quantitative`.  \n\n**Gender**, **Letter Grade**, **Breakfast Type**, **Marital Status**, and **Zip Code** can be thought of as labels for a group of items or individuals. Hence, these are `categorical`.\n\n_____________________\n\n# Continuous vs. Discrete\n\nTo consider if we have continuous or discrete data, we should see if we can split our data into smaller and smaller units.  Consider time - we could measure an event in years, months, days, hours, minutes, or seconds, and even at seconds we know there are smaller units we could measure time in.  Therefore, we know this data type is continuous.  **Height**, **age**, and **income** are all examples of `continuous data`. Alternatively, the **number of pages in a book**, **dogs I count outside a coffee shop**, or **trees in a yard** are `discrete data`.  We would not want to split our dogs in half.\n______________\n\n# Ordinal vs. Nominal\n\nIn looking at categorical variables, we found **Gender**, **Marital Status**, **Zip Code** and your **Breakfast items** are `nominal variables` where there is no order ranking associated with this type of data.  Whether you ate cereal, toast, eggs, or only coffee for breakfast; there is no rank ordering associated with your breakfast.  \n \nAlternatively, the **Letter Grade** or **Survey Ratings** have a rank ordering associated with it, as `ordinal data`.  If you receive an A, this is higher than an A-.  An A- is ranked higher than a B+, and so on...  Ordinal variables frequently occur on rating scales from very poor to very good.  In many cases we turn these ordinal variables into numbers, as we can more easily analyze them, but more on this later!\n__________________\n\n# Final Words\n\nIn this section, we looked at the different data types we might work with in the world around us.  When we work with data in the real world, it might not be very clean - sometimes there are typos or missing values.  When this is the case, simply having some expertise regarding the data and knowing the data type can assist in our ability to ‘clean’ this data.  Understanding data types can also assist in our ability to build visuals to best explain the data.  But more on this very soon!",

Lie factor depicts the degree to which a visualization distorts or misrepresents the data values being plotted. It is calculated in the following way:\n\n<div class=\"mathquill\">\\text{lie factor} =\\frac{\\Delta \\text{visual}/\\text{visual}_\\text{start}}{\\Delta \\text{data}/\\text{data}_\\text{start}}</div>\n\nThe delta symbol (<span class=\"mathquill\">\\Delta</span>) stands for difference or change. In words, the lie factor is the relative change shown in the graphic divided by the actual relative change in the data. Ideally, the lie factor should be 1: any other value means that there is some mismatch in the ratio of depicted change to actual change.\n\n______\n\n### Lie Factor in the Video\n\nThe lie factor shown in the video was in comparing the largest to the smallest doctor in terms of pixels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If we have more than two variables, however, we have to start considering other visual encodings for the additional variables.\n\nIn general, **color and shape** are best for **categorical** variables, while the **size of marker** can assist in adding additional **quantitative data**, as we demonstrated here.\n\nOnly use these additional encodings when absolutely necessary.  Often, overuse of these additional encodings suggest you are providing too much information in a single plot.  **Instead, it might be better to break the information into multiple individual messages**, so the audience can understand every aspect of your message.  You can also build in each aspect one at a time, which you saw in the previous lesson with [Hans Rosling](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd098/parts/05a8ba39-eb63-426e-9b98-755883bc81d6/modules/f922e0f7-d718-4d00-a0e7-13b8498cf7d3/lessons/4535e649-760e-466d-a3e3-18440486dbd1/concepts/6719321b-ecaa-4342-bbed-63bd404408e4).  This feels less overwhelming than if you just saw this plot all at once.\n\n### Extra: Code\n\nSome of the plots in this presentation were created using the programming language R, and a very popular library known as **ggplot2**.  Though this is beyond the scope of this course, the code used to create these visualizations is provided below:\n\n```\ninstall.packages('ggplot2')\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndf = read.csv(file.choose()) #select your dataset \ndf2 = head(df, 30)\n\n\nqplot(df2$Math.SAT, df2$Verbal.SAT, xlab = 'Math SAT Score', \n      ylab = 'Verbal SAT Score', main = 'Average SAT Scores By College')\n\nqplot(df2$Math.SAT, df2$Verbal.SAT, xlab = 'Math SAT Score', \n      ylab = 'Verbal SAT Score', main = 'Average SAT Scores By College', \n      color = as.factor(df2$Public..1...Private..2.))\n\nqplot(df2$Math.SAT, df2$Verbal.SAT, xlab = 'Math SAT Score',\n      ylab = 'Verbal SAT Score', main = 'Average SAT Scores By College',\n      shape = as.factor(df2$Public..1...Private..2.), color = df2$stud..fac..ratio)\n\nggplot(df2, aes(x=Math.SAT, y=Verbal.SAT, group=stud..fac..ratio)) +\n  geom_point(aes(shape=stud..fac..ratio, color=as.factor(df2$Public..1...Private..2.))\n```",
