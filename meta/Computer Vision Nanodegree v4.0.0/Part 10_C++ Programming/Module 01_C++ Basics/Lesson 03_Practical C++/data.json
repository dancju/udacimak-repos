But we humans can read and understand these languages, so they are convenient for us to code in.\n\nYour code needs to be translated into a language that your CPU understands. Interpreted languages and compiled languages get translated in different ways. When you run a Python program, there is a translator (ie an interpreter), that reads a line of your code, translates a line of code for the CPU, and then executes your  code line on the CPU. Then the next line gets translated and executed. Then the next, etc. The reality is a bit more complex, but that is the gist of an interpreted language like Python.\n\nA compiled language, on the other hand, translates all of your code into the CPU's language. And then your code gets executed. So when running a C++ program, there is an extra step where you first compile your code and then a second step where you execute your code. Python, on the other hand, only has the execution step.\n\nThe C++ code you have been writing in the classroom actually is being compiled first and then executed, but it's happening behind the scenes. If you want to run your C++ programs locally on your computer, you're going to need to first compile the code and then execute it yourself.",

Michael is a student in this Nanodegree and put together some **exceptionally** detailed documentation to help you get started with C++.\n\n* [Windows C++ Setup Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PA3YcIKpANBZuHLX6tz7bVw60ug_DM1_V_yFKyrMP-s/edit?usp=sharing)\n * Per student Tarun, the guide document for IDE setup suggests moving the .sln file to parent directory, along with the .vcproj file. To avoid errors, the .sln file needs to be hand modified with updated path.\n* [Mac C++ Setup Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FoIc9X0NcM-0y0dgXCzJcpu5lVXGFqS62mb1ABLDT1M/edit)\n\nBelow you'll find further instructions as well, although Michael's documents should be enough to get things running.",

For example, if you have a main.cpp, you would open the console and navigate to the directory with the file. \n\nYou will see that the microsoft tutorial suggests compiling your code with the following command:\n```\ncl /W4 /EHsc main.cpp\n```\n\nThe /W4 and /EHsc are options that will compile your code with warnings and [error handing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/eh-exception-handling-model).\n\nThe compiler outputs an .obj file, which contains the instructions for the CPU. You will also see a .exe file that will get your code running.\n\nNow typing\n```\nmain\n```\n\nat the command prompt should get your program running.\n\nIf your program has multiple .cpp files, then you compile with:\n```\ncl /W4 /EHsc file1.cpp file2.cpp file3.cpp\n```\n\nThe name of the .obj and .exe files will be file1.",

In general, you will need to download the \"command line developer tools\" from the Apple developer website. \n\nAs a first step, see if you already have a compiler on your system called **g++**. Open the Terminal application, and type\n```\ng++\n```\n\nIf g++ is installed, you should get an error message like `no input files`. If g++ is not installed and you are using a relatively newer version of Mac OS,  a dialogue box will pop up asking you if you would like to install the command line tools. Click \"Install\". \n\nHowever, on older Mac OS systems, you'll need to go to the Apple developer's website and download the command line developer tools. Go to this [link](https://developer.apple.com/download/). You will need to create an Apple ID if you do not already have one. Enter your Apple ID and password. \n\nOn the downloads page, there is a search box in the top left corner. Search for \"command line developer tools\". Then download and install the developer tools for your OS version. \n\nNow go back to the Terminal and type\n```\ng++\n```\n\nYou should now get an error message `no input files`. \n\nTo compile a program you would type:\n```\ng++ filename.cpp\n```\n\nor with multiple .cpp files:\n```\ng++ filename1.cpp filename2.cpp filename3.cpp\n```\n\nThe compiler will create an executable file named `a.out`.

And some compilers might implement a feature differently.\n\nThere are currently five published C++ standards with the earliest standard called **C++98** and the most recent standard **C++17**. The number designates the year in which the standard was published such as 1998 and 2017.\n\nThus far, the classroom has been compiling your code with the oldest standard: **C++98**. We have used C++98 so that you could get the basics of C++ down without worrying about advanced features.\n\nAs an example of a more advanced features, **C++11**, allows you to initialize a vector with the following syntax:\n\n```\nvector<int> myvector = {5, 4, 9, 1, 10}\n```\n\nThere is generally a lag of a few years between publication of a standard and industry adoption.

Both of these files are part of the C++ Standard Library.\n\nfstream provides functions and classes for reading in and outputting files. \n\nThis line of code reads in the file \"matrix.txt\" and then creates an object called \"matrixfile\" that you can use for reading in the text file:\n```\n    ifstream matrixfile (\"matrix.txt\");\n```\n\nThe if statement that follows checks that the file opened correctly:\n```\n\tif (matrixfile.is_open()) {\n```\n\nand then a while loop reads the file one line at a time. Each line is placed into a variable called \"line\":\n```\n\tif (matrixfile.is_open()) {\n\t\twhile (getline (matrixfile, line)) {\n```\n\nIf you look at the text file, each line in this case is a string consisting of floats, commas and spaces. For example, \"1, 6, 2, 10.5\".\n\nThe sstream file in the Standard Library provides functionality for manipulating and parsing the string. In the code, you'll see that first a sstream object was declared and then later the ss object was used to cycle through and parse each line of the text file:\n```\nstringstream ss;\n\t\n....\n\nss.clear();\nss.str(\"\");\nss.str(line);\n\nwhile(ss >> i) {\n\trow.push_back(i);\n\t\n\tif (ss.peek() == ',' || ss.peek() == ' ') {\n\t\tss.ignore();\n\t}\n}```\n\nIn other words, the code finds a float number and appends the number to the vector called row. The line `ss.peek()` looks at the next character to see if it is a comma or a space and ignores commas or spaces.\n\nNote as well that when you are done with reading in the file, it's a good habit to close the file.\n```\nmatrixfile.close();\n```\n\nIf you ever write a programming that opens many files simultaneously and never closes them, your program could crash.",

              "text": "### Exercise 1\n\nIn the robot localization lectures, Sebastian Thrun led you through Python code for one-dimensional robot sensing and robot movement. You ended up with a sense() function for updating probabilities based on a sensor measurement. You also had a move() function that updated probabilities based on robot movement across a grid.\n\nTranslate the following code from Python into C++:\n\n```python\np = [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]\nworld = ['green', 'red', 'red', 'green', 'green']\nmeasurements = ['red', 'green']\nmotions = [1,1]\npHit = 0.6\npMiss = 0.2\npExact = 0.8\npOvershoot = 0.1\npUndershoot = 0.1\n\ndef sense(p, Z):\n    q=[]\n    for i in range(len(p)):\n        hit = (Z == world[i])\n        q.append(p[i] * (hit * pHit + (1-hit) * pMiss))\n    s = sum(q)\n    for i in range(len(q)):\n        q[i] = q[i] / s\n    return q\n\ndef move(p, U):\n    q = []\n    for i in range(len(p)):\n        s = pExact * p[(i-U) % len(p)]\n        s = s + pOvershoot * p[(i-U-1) % len(p)]\n        s = s + pUndershoot * p[(i-U+1) % len(p)]\n        q.append(s)\n    return q\n\nfor k in range(len(measurements)):\n    p = sense(p, measurements[k])\n    p = move(p, motions[k])\n    \nprint p         \n```\n\nYou can find one potential solution to the above translation [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/iSDC/CPP_basics_EX1_solution.cpp). \n\nThe expected output is:\n```python\n0.211579 0.151579 0.0810526 0.168421 0.387368\n```",
