We knew the shape of the function, and we knew its orientation from our plot, so when we found the point where the derivative equaled 0, we knew we had found the minimum. However, in general, points where the derivative equals 0 could be minima, maxima, or [saddle points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle_point). To distinguish between these cases, we need to check the function's curvature around the point in question. We do this using the second derivative of the function. For a function of one variable, the rule is:\n\n* If <span class=\"mathquill\">\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2y}{\\mathrm{d}x^2}(x_0) < 0</span> then <span class=\"mathquill\">f</span> has a local maximum at <span class=\"mathquill\">x_0</span>.\n* If <span class=\"mathquill\">\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2y}{\\mathrm{d}x^2}(x_0) > 0</span> then <span class=\"mathquill\">f</span> has a local minimum at <span class=\"mathquill\">x_0</span>.\n* If <span class=\"mathquill\">\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2y}{\\mathrm{d}x^2}(x_0) = 0</span>, the test is inconclusive.\n\n\nSo in the case of the function above, we have \n\n<div class=\"mathquill\">\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x} = 2(x-1)</div>\n\nso,\n\n<div class=\"mathquill\">\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2y}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} = 2</div>\n\nThe second derivative is positive for all <span class=\"mathquill\">x</span>, which means the function's slope is increasing everywhere, hence the function's curvature is upward everywhere.

In general, we know that we want high returns and low variance of returns, and that the weights on each asset in our portfolio should sum to 1. \n\nLet's again consider a portfolio a portfolio with 2 assets in it, Stock A and Stock B. We want to solve for the weight on each asset, <span class=\"mathquill\">x_A</span> and <span class=\"mathquill\">x_B</span>.\n\nOur objective function for this problem is the expression for the portfolio variance: \n\n<div class=\"mathquill\">(1)\\;\\sigma_P^2= x_A^2\\sigma_A^2 + x_B^2\\sigma_B^2 + 2x_Ax_B\\sigma_A\\sigma_B\\rho_{r_Ar_B}.</div>\n\nThis is what we will seek to _minimize_.\n\nWe've seen these quantities before, but let's just briefly recall what all these symbols mean:\n<span class=\"mathquill\">\\sigma_P^2</span> is the portfolio variance.\n<span class=\"mathquill\">\\sigma_A^2</span> is the variance of the return of Stock A.\n<span class=\"mathquill\">\\sigma_B^2</span>is the variance of the return of Stock B.\n<span class=\"mathquill\">\\rho_{r_Ar_B}</span>is the correlation between the returns of stocks A and B.\n\nOur only constraint is:<div class=\"mathquill\">(2)\\;x_A + x_B = 1\n</div>\n\nIt turns out that this is a problem we can solve analytically. If we substitute <span class=\"mathquill\">(2)</span> into <span class=\"mathquill\">(1)</span>, we will get a function of a single variable: \n\n<div class=\"mathquill\">\\sigma_P^2= x_A^2\\sigma_A^2 + (1-x_A)^2\\sigma_B^2 + 2x_A(1-x_A)\\sigma_A\\sigma_B\\rho_{r_Ar_B}</div>\n\nNow, let's take a breather and look at a plot of <span class=\"mathquill\">\\sigma_P^2</span> as a function of <span class=\"mathquill\">x_A</span>, to get a sense of what the function looks like. Let's assume some values for the variables <span class=\"mathquill\">\\sigma_A</span>, <span class=\"mathquill\">\\sigma_B</span>, and <span class=\"mathquill\">\\rho_{r_Ar_B}</span>.\n\nIf, <span class=\"mathquill\">\\sigma_A = 0.1</span>, <span class=\"mathquill\">\\sigma_B = 0.05</span>, and <span class=\"mathquill\">\\rho_{r_Ar_B} = 0.25</span>, then the plot looks like this: ",

If we wanted to know the expected portfolio mean, we only have to remember that it is the weighted sum of the individual portfolio means:\n\n<div class=\"mathquill\">\\mu_P = \\mu_Ax_A + \\mu_Bx_B</div>\n\nTo be sure our solution is a _minimum_, we should check the second-order condition.

Earlier, we were allowing our portfolio weights to be negative or positive, as long as they summed to 1. If a weight turned out to be negative, we would consider the absolute value of that number to be the size of the _short_ position to take on that asset. If your strategy does not allow you to take short positions, your portfolio weights will all need to be positive numbers. In order to enforce this in the optimization problem, you would add the constraint that every <span class=\"mathquill\">x_i</span> in the <span class=\"mathquill\">\\mathbf{x}</span> vector is _positive_.\n\n**no short selling:**\n<span class=\"mathquill\">\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;0 \\leq x_i \\leq 1,\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;i=1,2,\\ldots,n</span>\n\nYou may choose to impose constraints that would limit your portfolio allocations in individual sectors, such as technology or energy. You could do this by limiting the sum of weights for assets in each sector.\n\n**sector limits:**\n<span class=\"mathquill\">\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;x_{\\mathrm{biotech1}} + x_{\\mathrm{biotech2}} + x_{\\mathrm{biotech3}} \\leq  M,\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;M = \\mathrm{percent\\;of\\;portfolio\\;to\\;invest\\;in\\;biotech\\;companies}</span>\n\nIf your optimization objective seeks to minimize portfolio variance, you might also incorporate into the problem a goal for the total portfolio return. You can do this by adding a constraint on the portfolio return.\n\n**constraint on portfolio return:**\n<span class=\"mathquill\">\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\mathbf{x}^\\mathrm{T} \\mathbf{\\mu} \\geq r_{\\mathrm{min}}, \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;r_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\mathrm{minimum\\;acceptable\\;portfolio\\;return}</span>\n\n",

              "text": "## How to use ``cvxpy``\n\n**Import**: First, you need to import the package:``import cvxpy as cvx``\n\n**Steps**: Optimization problems involve finding the values of a _variable_ that minimize an  _objective function_ under a set of _constraints_ on the range of possible values the variable can take. So we need to use ``cvxpy`` to declare the _variable_, _objective function_ and _constraints_, and then solve the problem.\n\n**Optimization variable**: Use ``cvx.Variable()`` to declare an optimization variable. For portfolio optimization, this will be <span class=\"mathquill\">\\mathbf{x}</span>, the vector of weights on the assets. Use the argument to declare the size of the variable; e.g. ``x = cvx.Variable(2)`` declares that <span class=\"mathquill\">\\mathbf{x}</span> is a vector of length 2. In general, variables can be scalars, vectors, or matrices.\n\n**Objective function**: Use ``cvx.Minimize()`` to declare the objective function. For example, if the objective function is <span class=\"mathquill\">(\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y})^2</span>, you would declare it to be: ``objective = cvx.Minimize((x - y)**2)``.\n\n**Constraints**: You must specify the problem constraints with a list of expressions. For example, if the constraints are <span class=\"mathquill\">\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y} = 1</span> and <span class=\"mathquill\">\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y} \\geq 1</span> you would create the list: ``constraints = [x + y == 1, x - y >= 1]``. Equality and inequality constraints are elementwise, whether they involve scalars, vectors, or matrices. For example, together the constraints ``0 <= x`` and ``x <= 1`` mean that every entry of <span class=\"mathquill\">\\mathbf{x}</span> is between 0 and 1. You cannot construct inequalities with < and >. Strict inequalities don’t make sense in a real world setting. Also, you cannot chain constraints together, e.g., ``0 <= x <= 1`` or ``x == y == 2``.\n\n**Quadratic form**: Use ``cvx.quad_form()`` to create a quadratic form. For example, if you want to minimize portfolio variance, and you have a covariance matrix <span class=\"mathquill\">\\mathbf{P}</span>, the quantity ``cvx.quad_form(x, P)`` represents the quadratic form <span class=\"mathquill\">\\mathbf{x}^\\mathrm{T}\\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{x}</span>, the portfolio variance.\n\n**Norm**: Use ``cvx.norm()`` to create a norm term. For example, to minimize the distance between <span class=\"mathquill\">\\mathbf{x}</span> and another vector,  <span class=\"mathquill\">\\mathbf{b}</span>, i.e. <span class=\"mathquill\">\\left \\| \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{b} \\right \\|_2</span>, create a term in the objective function ``cvx.norm(x-b, 2)``. The second argument specifies the type of norm; for an L2-norm, use the argument 2.\n\n**Constants**: Constants are the quantities in objective or constraint expressions that are not Variables. You can use your numeric library of choice to construct matrix and vector constants. For instance, if ``x`` is a ``cvxpy`` ``Variable`` in the expression ``A*x + b``, ``A`` and ``b`` could be Numpy ndarrays, Numpy matrices, or SciPy sparse matrices. ``A`` and ``b`` could even be different types.\n\n**Optimization problem**: The core step in using ``cvxpy`` to solve an optimization problem is to specify the problem. Remember that an optimization problem involves minimizing an _objective function_, under some _constraints_, so to specify the problem, you need both of these. Use ``cvx.Problem()`` to declare the optimization problem. For example, ``problem = cvx.Problem(objective, constraints)``, where ``objective`` and ``constraints`` are quantities you've defined earlier. Problems are immutable. This means that you cannot modify a problem’s objective or constraints after you have created it. If you find yourself wanting to add a constraint to an existing problem, you should instead create a new problem.\n\n**Solve**: Use ``problem.solve()`` to run the optimization solver.\n\n**Status**: Use ``problem.status`` to access the status of the problem and check whether it has been determined to be unfeasible or unbounded.\n\n**Results**: Use ``problem.value`` to access the optimal value of the objective function. Use e.g. ``x.value`` to access the optimal value of the optimization variable.\n",
