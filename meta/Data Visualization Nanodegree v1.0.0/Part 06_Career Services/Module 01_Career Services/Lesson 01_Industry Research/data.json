Most of the time, we end up feeling as though we’re just throwing our applications out there with little-to-no positive response to show for it.\n\nThere's a better way to do this.\n\nAt Udacity, we recommend you take a proactive approach to the job search process. By **first** building your self-confidence and clearly identifying your needs and wants, you’ll be in a better position to seek out jobs that will actually make a lasting impact on your future. You'll know what you want - and what you don't want - in a job. You can also better visualize your path to that job and make immediate plans. For example, perhaps your next job first requires more skills that you don’t yet have, and thus requires a few months of learning and practice.\n\n> A career-oriented self-reflection helps you make sure you're on the right track. The self-reflection builds your blueprint for success.\n\nBelow is an exercise to help you reflect and think about your blueprint. At first, you may be surprised by how much you write! Seeing your professional wants and needs written down can provide clarity or new insights that you weren’t aware of before. This self-reflection has been designed to get to the heart of what you want out of your career.\n\nMaybe you’ve already decided what your dream job is, or maybe you don’t have the slightest clue. Regardless of where you are on this spectrum, you must first **design your own blueprint for success and professional fulfillment**. Use the exercise below to guide your self-reflection. \n\n> **Note**: Don't worry about getting the correct answer. Treat this exercise as an opportunity to begin thinking about your personal and professional needs and desires.\n\nYou can always copy your notes from this exercise into a new document and continue working on it! For now, let's get started!",

              "text": "Let's dive deeper into what asking these questions help you understand.\n\n### Why did you choose to pursue a new career?\n\nAt first glance, this may seem like an obvious question. Take a moment to look beyond that and truly reflect on what in your personal life is the driving force behind your desire. Why this career path? Why right now? Here are some of the common reasons Udacity Alumni give for pursuing a new career field.\n\n> \"I realized that I’m not feeling fulfilled in my current career path and want to transition to a job that will challenge and excite me.\"\n\n> \"I never thought of myself as someone who could successfully code and develop a mobile app, and I want to give myself that opportunity.\"\n\n> \"I have a family that depends on me and I need a better job to continue to provide for them.\"\n\nSee if you can distill your personal reasons for pursuing this career path into one single, assertive sentence. **Let this sentence stand as your mission statement.** This mission statement will guide you as you learn, as well as remind you of what you’re striving towards when you face challenges in your learning and job search later on.\n\n### What questions do you currently have about the tech industry?\nIt’s critical to articulate and maintain an active interest in the technologies and communities that influence the world you want to establish yourself in. Here are a few examples of questions you might have:\n\n> What does [industry term] mean?\n\n> Why is this technology used in this way?\n\n> Who invented a particular practice and how long has it been in use?\n\n> How can I make [this particular technology] better?\n\nAsking thoughtful questions is a valuable skill to employers; it shows them that **you understand the concepts and materials well enough to question them**. Additionally, as you gain expertise, you may need to answer some of these same questions for those who are where you are now!\n\n### What skills do you want improve or develop?\nHow can you continue to retain and improve upon relevant skills? Furthermore, which skills do you still need to develop in order to meet the qualifications for your next job? These are questions that you should think about, whether you are pursuing a new opportunity or taking the next step in your career.\n\nThe benefit of constantly working on existing and new skills is that you will be accumulating a body of work which can be included in your portfolio to showcase to employers.\n\nIn order to know which new skills you should focus on developing, you must become familiar with the common skills that the role you're interested in typically requires.\n\nUse your research of the role to guide your decisions on which skills to focus on sharpening next. Explore these potential job roles by conducting a simple Google search - you'll find blog posts, articles and other guides explaining more about the job.",

              "text": "### What are your preferences for a compatible work environment?\nYou may already have some idea of what you need and want in a job, but taking the time to articulate each factor may reveal what is actually the most important to you. Below we’ve provided a list of things that you may take into consideration during your job search; we highly recommend crafting a list of your own.\n\n* Type of employment (do you want a full-time job or part-time/contract opportunity?)\n* Work day flexibility (for example, would you prefer a steady 9-5 or the ability to work your own hours so long as you get the work done?)\n* Benefits (how much do things such as healthcare, stocks or equity, and vacation days matter to you?)\n* Job growth opportunities (how do you want the company to support you in your career development?)\n* Perks (how much do things like foosball tables, company-sponsored lunches, and happy hours matter to you?)\n\n### What are 2-3 personal values that matter to you above all?\nEach company has its own mission and values, which guide its business approach and company decisions. Identifying your own key values will help you look for companies where you will be able to do work that aligns with and reinforces these values. You might be surprised by the emphasis placed on identifying personal values, but consider this: if you work at a company that clashes with what you personally believe is important, you probably won't be happy.\n\nYou can start exploring this question by coming up with 2-3 (or more!) values that are most important to you. Once you have articulated these values, extend your research and begin networking to learn how you can identify a company that exemplifies these values. What does this look like? Hear from Trinh's experience:\n\n> \"Years ago, I was looking for a new job and originally thought myself open to anything - any job, any field. My attempts to network were not fruitful - every conversation seemed so forced and awkward!\n\n> I realized that I didn't just want _any_ job - I didn't have a clear idea of an exact role, but I knew I wanted to work in education and, in particular, help young students. I then started to find people on LinkedIn who worked in afterschool programs, school lunch services, and college prep non-profits. I reached out to them for informational interviews and got job leads on small organizations and companies.\n\n> These networking attempts were actually fruitful because I was interested and passionate, which resonated well with others and they were more willing to help me. One person added me to a private jobs mailing list, which is how I found my job!\"\n\n### Separate Your Job Desires and Job Needs\n\nAfter performing a self-reflection, you have a blueprint for conducting your career and industry research. Furthermore, identifying your \"must-haves\" and \"nice-to-haves\" will help you determine which things are job desires and which are job needs. \n\nConsider this example:\n\n> To Clara, it is a necessity that her job be about working on environmental sustainability. For her, a nice-to-have to have is the option to work remotely, but she wouldn't mind working somewhere that didn't provide this option. \n\n> Jenny loves to travel regularly, and remote work is required for her to keep her lifestyle. Working in environmental sustainability would be nice to have, but she's open to any good job that allows her to telecommute.\n\n> To Clara, environmental sustainability is a \"must-have\" because it's her passion in life and where she wants to make her mark. Even if she got an amazing job in another field, she wouldn't be as happy working for a company whose mission didn't align with hers. However, although it would be nice to work remotely, she's willing to come into the office every day or even move cities for a chance to follow her passion.\n\n> To Jenny, the ability to travel is the most important thing for her, since her passion in life is meeting new people and exploring new places. She's always been interested in environmental sustainability, but there are also other rewarding fields out there in education, healthcare, and services. She's open to any remote roles in those industries.\n\nUsing the list you created for the \"compatible environments\" question, circle some factors that immediately jump out to you as “must-haves” right now. For now, consider everything else a “nice-to-have”. These factors may change over time or you may discover more, but it’s good to have a baseline to work with at the start of your career development!",

Now it’s time to find the places that can help you meet those goals! In the exercise below, you will create a list of companies that interest you. Don’t be afraid to do some exploring outside of your industries as well—there are many tech jobs in traditionally non-tech sectors.\n\nThe goal of this exercise is to determine the next stop on your career path - likely a new job or role. With that stop in mind, you can map your journey with what to study next and specific skills to develop for that next job.\n\n**Tip:** Don’t forget that this process will be a marathon, not a sprint. Explore careers and new industries with persistent curiosity. Be sure to keep your notebook next to you so you can write new questions as they come up.",

The information you collect should reflect why you're interested in the company, what makes them a good fit for you, and any basic information you should know as an applicant. \n\nFor example, imagine that you are interested in companies located in Mountain View, and decide to do more research on one called Udacity. The notes you take should look something like this: \n\n* **Primary Product(s)**\n * Nanodegree programs\n * Free, single courses\n * Udacity Connect\n * Corporate training \n* **History of the company or organization**\n * Founded in 2011 by David Stavens, Mike Sokolsky, Sebastian Thrun\n * Udacity originally focused on offering university-style courses, but in 2015, Udacity started the Nanodegree program, a paid credential program which is its main product today. \n* **Company Mission**\n * Democratize education by offering world-class higher education opportunities that are accessible, flexible, and economical. \n * \"Virtually anyone on the planet with an internet connection and a commitment to self-empowerment through learning can come to Udacity, master a suite of job-ready skills, and pursue rewarding employment.\"\n* **Leadership**\n * CEO: Vish Makhijani\n * President: Sebastian Thrun\n * VP, Careers: Kathleen Mullaney (I'm interested in working on career development)  \n * Knowing the company's leadership, you can search for talks, blog posts, or articles about them. This will give you insight on their interests, goals for Udacity, and background information that can be talking points when you discuss Udacity.\n* **Why do you want to work here?**\n * The mission aligns with my own belief that lifelong learning is important. \n * I see many jobs are remote-friendly and I like that flexibility.\n * I'm interested in gaining experience in the online learning space. \n\n### Mapping Exercise\nNow, treat the space below as a notepad for recording notes on your research for each company.

For now, you should be able to get a good idea of how some companies in your intended industry perceive themselves. If anything seems too good to be true or draws your curiosity, make note of them. You can dig in a little bit on sites like [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm), which allows employees and interviewees to post information about their experiences anonymously.\n\n### Get to Know a Company's Product\nYou've taken a quick snapshot of three companies. If one or more of them interest you further, your next step is to better understand their products.\n\nWe cannot stress enough how important it is to have an understanding of a company’s product when you decide to apply for a job. If the product is free to acquire (for example, an app that you can download and test out), use it for a few days and take notes on what your user experience is like. If you cannot pay for the product, or the product is inaccessible to you, search for reviews online and see what people who have used it have written. Here are a couple of things to watch out for that will help you understand the product’s role in the current market:\n\n* How many users does it currently have? Where does it rank against its competitors?\n* Have any major publications (The New York Times, Bloomberg Business, Wired, etc.) covered the product or company’s growth and development?\n* Are there any major glitches, bugs, or other technical flaws that have been reported and have gone unresolved?\n* In your opinion, what are the best attributes of the product? What are things to be fixed or improved?\n\nBy learning the most up-to-date information on a company's product, you will be able to speak more eloquently in an interview or to a company contact, showcasing your in-depth knowledge of the company. \n\n### Detours can happen! Detours can be for the better!\nLike any journey, there can be roadblocks and detours. An opportunity can end up not working out, or you can change your mind about your destination midway through. All of this is natural. Many professionals who look back on their career say they got to where they are today via unexpected jobs or opportunities. You are likely one of these people already!",

Usually, an informational interview is a one-on-one informal meeting, phone call or video conference where you lead a conversation with someone who is currently working in a role, company, or industry you are interested in.\n\n### Why is it useful?\nBeing able to speak with those already working in the industry will allow you to confirm or refute the information you've collected on your own. It is an opportunity for you to learn about company culture, responsibilities of a role from an internal perspective, industry prospects, or even open positions at the company. Informational interviews are also a great way to make new professional connections and expand your network, whether you’re currently active on the job market or not.\n\nIn this lesson, we will cover the following topics:\n\n* How to find people for an informational interview\n* How to reach out to someone \n* What to ask in an informational interview\n* What to do after the informational interview to keep the conversation going\n",

              "text": "### How to Reach Out\n\nThere are numerous avenues to reach out to people. You can do a search on LinkedIn and message a few people with interesting backgrounds or current jobs. Or, you can attend a public networking event and ask someone you meet there.\n\nConsider the following tips on how to start reaching to people for informational interviews.\n\n#### Leverage your existing network. \n\nFriends, former supervisors, colleagues, family, and alumni groups are all communities filled with people who have your best interest at heart. **If you've enrolled in a Nanodegree program, you are already a part of a robust community of driven, supportive people -\n your Nanodegree community!**\n\nAsking your community at large is the easiest way to get information. Sometimes, you don't even need to ask a specific person; you can post a message like this on your social media profile:\n\n > “Hey! I am currently in the process of transitioning into [x field] and would love to talk to any [y roles or employees at z company] to gain a better understanding of the work and industry. Please send me a direct message, and I’ll be happy to buy you coffee!”\n\n#### Target meetups, career fairs, public events, and LinkedIn. \n\nIndustry professionals are often interested in maintaining an active network and mentoring new talent. While each individual may have their own style and time constraints, being proactive and letting others know you are both interested and dedicated can yield great conversations and future contacts.\n\n#### Target companies and roles separately. \n\nConsider this example: if you are seeking out a product manager position but your only contact at your dream company is someone in Sales, you can still take the opportunity to learn more about the company culture and vision. They may also be able to provide an introduction to a product manager within the company. On the other hand, speaking with a product manager at a company or in an industry outside of your immediate interests can also be worthwhile as a way to learn about the role’s professional responsibilities.\n\n### Request an Informational Interview\n\nAn initial email or longer LinkedIn message are two of the most common ways of extending a request for an informational interview. Consider the following when crafting your message:\n\n* **Your tone should be gracious**; at no point should you assume that they are obligated to offer you their time or attention, regardless of how you know each other.\n* **Make sure that your email is concise and specific.** For example, if you're hoping for a 20-minute phone call, you can say: \"If you have time for a 20-minute phone call, I would appreciate the opportunity to learn more about the company.\"\n* **Sometimes, you will not get an immediate reply.** The person could be on vacation or overwhelmed with messages. \n * Be sure to allow enough time (up to 2 weeks) for a response. If they have not responded within a week, you can send one follow-up inquiry.\n\nIf you aren’t able to schedule a live conversation, the contact may be still willing to answer some questions over email or LinkedIn.\n\n### Exercise\n\nComplete the exercise below in order to help you draft a good email or message requesting a meeting. In this exercise, we've provided examples of different types of asks and content that you can find in an informational interview request.\n\n**Try to get the correct match by dragging each example next to the corresponding content type in the table below.**",

We recommend doing preliminary research on both the company and the individual, drafting sample questions, and practicing beforehand. \n\nBelow are a few guidelines:\n\n* Come prepared with smart, relevant questions. If you can find the answer to your question on the person's LinkedIn profile, in a Google search, or on the company website, you can be fairly confident that it won’t be the best question to ask. \n* Opt for open-ended questions with potential for insightful answers. \n* Before the interview, create a sample question list. \n* During the interview, take notes on the information you learn and be mindful of your goals. \n* Ask clarifying questions as needed.\n\n### Goals\n \nBe goal-oriented throughout the interview. Think of a few outcomes you would like to achieve at the end of the interview. For example, your goal may be to build your network, find more contacts, or access insider information about company and culture. \n \nWe also recommend approaching the interview as an opportunity to gain recommendations for resources (blogs, books, etc.) relevant to your industry.\n \nFinally, make it a goal to leave a positive impression. Even if your new contact isn’t able to directly help you advance in your job search right now, you never know when they may think of you for a future opportunity.\n\n### Sample Questions Quiz",

Next, we'd like to break down the reasons for why some of these questions are unsuitable for an informational interview and should be avoided. Also, we'll go over what you can ask instead!\n\n#### Can you tell me about [x company controversy]?\n\n**Why not to ask:** As an employee, it can be both uncomfortable and awkward for them to make public comments to you about such a sensitive topic. The purpose of this informational interview is for you to develop a rapport with a valuable professional connection.\n\n**What to ask instead:** Rather than focusing on such a negative topic, steer the conversation toward your shared passions and professional interests. If it's absolutely necessary for you to address an area of concern, do so in a polite and constructive way by posing the question after you have developed a stronger rapport with them. For example, instead of framing the conversation as company gossip, approach the question from a more professional angle: \"After doing research on your company, I noticed some comments on Glassdoor about [x issue]. Would you be able to shed some light on my concerns regarding these comments?\" \n\n#### How much do you make? \n\n**Why not to ask:** It’s normal to be curious about such a topic, especially since you will have your own expectations around the salary for a position you're interested in. However, this can be an inappropriate, private question to ask, especially the first time you meet.\n\n**What to ask instead:** If you wish to collect information on this topic, try posing a more general question to gauge the industry’s expected salary range for a position. Furthermore, don't forget to do some research on websites like [Paysa](https://www.paysa.com/salaries), which provides market salary data, to see if you can find a reliable answer on your own.\n\n#### Can I add you on Facebook?\n\n**Why not to ask:** You may find yourself developing a great connection with whomever you’re interviewing, but remember that you should keep the exchange professional. Furthermore, they may be hesitant about connecting on a social platform with someone who contacted them with inquiries about their professional experience and career advice.\n\n**What to ask instead:** If you’d like to maintain friendly but professional contact with them, politely ask if you can add them on LinkedIn (if you haven’t already).\n\n#### What other roles have you worked in? \n\n**Why not to ask:** This seems like a suitable question, but should actually be avoided because you should already know the answer! As part of your interview preparation, you’ll inevitably look up information on the interviewee’s work history via their LinkedIn profile. Remember, you want to spend the precious amount of time you have for this interview on getting answers to questions that you would not be able to find online.\n\n**What to ask instead:** If you wish to learn more about a certain aspect of their work experience, try preparing questions that show you've done your research and have put much thought into what you want to discuss with them. For example, \"I see you've worked at [this company]. Why did you decide to switch jobs?\"\n",

              "text": "### How to Keep the Conversation Going\n \nNow that you’ve made a personal connection, keep it going! Send a thank you note within 24 hours; email is fine! If anything particularly memorable happened during your conversation, you may want to mention it in order to reinforce that you were actively listening and engaged. \n \nWhen sending your thank you email, send your resume so they can introduce you to others and remember who you are. Over time, keep in touch through holiday greetings, sharing information about topics of interest, and keeping them posted on progress in your job search. People like to help others and hear that they are making a positive impact!\n \n### Final Takeaways\n \nThe most common questions about informational interviews stem from entering a new industry and uncertainty about how to make new connections. \n \nTo address these concerns, remember:\n \n* **People generally want to help!** It is a chance to give back, network and simply share excitement and  information about a job. You will likely be surprised by people's willingness to share.\n* **Start building relationships as soon as possible**; these are long-term relationships that will require some nurturing.\n* **Take advantage of your Udacity community.** Classmates, instructors, and support staff are all a part of your network.\n* **Get out of your comfort zone and learn to be proactive about asking.** The worst that can happen is that someone declines or does not respond to your request. But there will be people who don't decline and will respond!\n* **Be optimistic and resourceful.** Informational interviews are great learning experiences and practice for future job interviews.",
