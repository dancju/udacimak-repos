It's a challenging project, but we know you're up for the challenge! \n\nFor this project, you will build a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.\n\n## Why this project?\n\nThis content and comment structure is common across a large number of websites and applications, from news sites to blogs to aggregators like Hacker News and Reddit. By building this project, you will gain an understanding of how Redux can function in a standard type of application.\n",

Categories are simple objects containing a name and a URL path (usually the same string). The server does not have methods for creating/modifying/deleting these categories. If you wish to add to the categories for your app, simply add your desired object to the Array in `categories.js` in the provided server.\n\n### Posts\n\nPosts are the building blocks of your application. Posts include:\n\n| Attribute | Type | Description |\n|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| id                  | String | Unique identifier |\n| timestamp | Integer | Time created - default data tracks this in [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). You can use `Date.now()` to get this number|\n| title              | String | Post title |\n| body            | String | Post body |\n| author        | String | Post author |\n| category     | String | Should be one of the categories provided by the server\n| voteScore   | Integer | Net votes the post has received (default: 1) \n| deleted       | Boolean | Flag if post has been 'deleted' (inaccessible by the front end), (default: false)\n\n### Comments\n\nComments are attached to parent posts. They include: \n\n| Attribute | Type | Description |\n|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| id | String | Unique identifier |\n| parentId | String | id of the parent post\n| timestamp | Integer | Time created - default data tracks this in [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). You can use `Date.now()` to get this number|\n| body            | String | Comment body |\n| author        | String | Comment author |\n| voteScore   | Integer | Net votes the comment has received (default: 1) \n| deleted       | Boolean | Flag if comment has been 'deleted' (inaccessible by the front end), (default: false)\n| parentDeleted | Boolean | Flag for when the the parent post was deleted, but the comment itself was not.\n\n> This application is anonymous, with _no_ authentication or authorization. There are no user objects, and comments and posts accept any username/name for creation and editing.\n>\n> The server is _very_ light weight. It performs _zero_ data validation to enforce the above data types. Make sure you are using the correct types when sending requests to the server.\n\n## Views\n\nYour application should have, at a minimum, four views:\n\n* Default (Root)\n  - should list all available categories, which should link to a category view for that category\n  - should list all of the posts\n  - should have a control for changing the sort method for the list, including at minimum, order by voteScore and order by timestamp \n  - should have a control for adding a new post\n* Category View\n  - identical to the default view, but filtered to only include posts with the selected category\n* Post Detail View\n  - should show the details of a post, including: Title, Body, Author, timestamp (in user readable format), and vote score\n  - should list all of the comments for that post\n  - should have controls to edit or delete the post\n  - should have a control to add a new comment. \n  - implement comment form however you want (inline, modal, etc.)\n  - comments should also have controls for editing or deleting\n* Create/Edit View\n  - should have a form to create new post or edit existing posts\n  - when editing, existing data should be populated in the form\n\n> **Post/Comment UI** \n>\n> Posts and comments, in all views where they are displayed, should display their current score and should have controls to increment or decrement the `voteScore` for the object. \n> Posts should display the number of comments associated with the post.\n",

You can use the server's endpoints to manage storing, reading, updating, and deleting data for your application. We're providing you the backend server, but the frontend portion of the project you'll be developing from scratch, yourself!\n\nYou have a few options to start developing this project:\n\n* using your preconfigured Workspace\n* working locally on your own computer\n\nYour Workspace is a development environment integrated into the Udacity Classroom and comes preconfigured with the Readable project's backend server and a pre-scaffolded frontend using Create React App. You can both develop your entire in your Workspace as well as submit your project to be reviewed. For more information about your Workspace, check out the Project Workspace Info page.\n\nIf you'd like to work locally on your own computer:\n\n1. Download or fork and clone the [starter server repository](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter)\n* Install the requirements from the included `package.json` file: `npm install`\n* Start the server with `node server`\n* You can find the API documentation for the server in the [README](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter/blob/master/README.md), or by sending a `GET` request to the server root while it's running.\n* In a separate folder, develop your Readable app. You can use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to bootstrap your application, or you can install and configure React, Webpack and Babel on your own. Remember to install `redux` and `react-redux` as well.",

Look for opportunities to reuse your components. We recommend using `create-react-app` to bootstrap your project, but it is not required for this project. \n\nWhile the focus (and specification) of this project is based on functionality, rather than styling, please ensure that your app is presentable and easy to navigate.\n\n**Use Redux to manage your application state.** This includes all user actions and responses from the API server. You may use component state to handle form input fields and controlled components. Otherwise, the rest of the state for your application should be controlled by your reducers.\n",
