              "text": "A/B tests are used to test changes on a web page by running an experiment where a __control group__ sees the old version, while the __experiment group__ sees the new version. A __metric__ is then chosen to measure the level of engagement from users in each group. These results are then used to judge whether one version is more effective than the other. A/B testing is very much like hypothesis testing with the following hypotheses:\n\n- __Null Hypothesis:__ The new version is no better, or even worse, than the old version  \n- __Alternative Hypothesis:__ The new version is better than the old version\n\nIf we fail to reject the null hypothesis, the results would suggest keeping the old version. If we reject the null hypothesis, the results would suggest launching the change. These tests can be used for a wide variety of changes, from large feature additions to small adjustments in color, to see what change maximizes your metric the most.\n\nA/B testing also has its drawbacks. It can help you compare two options, but it can't tell you about an option you haven’t considered. It can also produce bias results when tested on existing users, due to factors like change aversion and novelty effect.\n\n- __Change Aversion:__ Existing users may give an unfair advantage to the old version, simply because they are unhappy with change, even if it’s ultimately for the better.\n- __Novelty Effect:__ Existing users may give an unfair advantage to the new version, because they’re excited or drawn to the change, even if it isn’t any better in the long run.\n\n\n You'll learn more about factors like these later.",

They hope that this new, more engaging design will increase the number of users that explore their courses, that is, move on to the second stage of the funnel. \n\nThe metric we will use is the click through rate for the Explore Courses button on the home page. __Click through rate (CTR)__ is often defined as the the number of clicks divided by the number of views. Since Audacity uses cookies, we can identify unique users and make sure we don't count the same one multiple times. For this experiment, we'll define our click through rate as:\n\n__CTR:  # clicks by unique users / # views by unique users__\n\nNow that we have our metric, let's set up our null and alternative hypotheses: \n\n<span class=\"mathquill\">H_0: CTR_{new} \\leq CTR _{old} </span>\n\n<span class=\"mathquill\">H_1: CTR_{new} > CTR _{old} </span>\n\nOur alternative hypothesis is what we want to prove to be true, in this case, that the new homepage design has a higher click through rate than the old homepage design. And the null hypothesis is what we assume to be true before analyzing data, which is that the new homepage design has a click through rate that is less than or equal to that of the old homepage design. As you’ve seen before, we can rearrange our hypotheses to look like this:\n\n<span class=\"mathquill\">H_0: CTR_{new} - CTR_{old} \\leq 0 </span>  \n<span class=\"mathquill\">H_1: CTR_{new} - CTR_{old} > 0 </span>  ",

We simulated the __sampling distribution__ for the difference in proportions (or difference in click through rates).\n3. We used this sampling distribution to simulate the __distribution under the null__ hypothesis, by creating a random normal distribution centered at 0 with the same spread and size.\n4. We computed the __p-value__ by finding the proportion of values in the null distribution that were greater than our observed difference.\n5.

We computed the __observed difference__ between the metric, average reading duration, for the control and experiment group.\n2. We simulated the __sampling distribution__ for the difference in means (or average reading durations).\n3. We used this sampling distribution to simulate the __distribution under the null__ hypothesis, by creating a random normal distribution centered at 0 with the same spread and size.\n4. We computed the __p-value__ by finding the proportion of values in the null distribution that were greater than our observed difference.\n5.
