You will not need to download any software, and you will still be able to test your skills!\n\nSQL is an extremely in demand skill.  [Tons of jobs use SQL](https://www.zippia.com/advice/what-jobs-use-sql/), and in the next lessons you will be learning how to utilize SQL to analyze data and answer business questions.\n\n## Project\n\nThe skills you learn in the classroom are directly extendable to writing **SQL** in other environments outside this classroom.  For the project at the end of these lessons, you will download a program that will allow you to write code on your local machine.  You will then analyze and answer business questions using data associated with a music store by querying their database.\n\n## Lesson Outline\n\nThere are three lessons in this Nanodegree aimed at helping you understand how to write SQL queries.  If you choose to take the [Predictive Analytics Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/predictive-analytics-for-business-nanodegree--nd008) or the [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) programs, these three lessons will also be a part of these programs.  However, there is also an additional lesson on Advanced SQL also taught by Derek!\n\nThe three lessons in this course aim at the following components of SQL:\n\n* **SQL Basics** - Here you will get your first taste at how SQL works, and learn the basics of the SQL language.  You will learn how to write code to interact with tables similar to the ones we analyzed in Excel earlier.  Specifically, you will learn a little about databases, the basic syntax of SQL, and you will write your first queries!<br><br>\n* **SQL Joins** - In this lesson, you will learn the real power of SQL.  You will learn about Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), and how to join multiple tables together from a relational database.  The power to join tables is what really moved companies to adopt this approach to holding data.<br><br>\n* **SQL Aggregations** - In this final lesson, you will learn some more advanced features of SQL.  You will gain the ability to summarize data from multiple tables in a database. <br><br>\n\nAt the end of these three lessons, you will be ready to tackle the project.  The project aims to assure you have mastered these three topics, but you will also see some of the more advanced queries that were not covered in this course.   These are just meant to introduce you to the advanced material, but don't feel discouraged if you didn't get these - they were beyond the scope of the class, and they are not required to pass the project!",

Hence, the last word of SQ**L** being **language**.  SQL is used all over the place beyond the databases we will utilize in this class.  With that being said, SQL is most popular for its interaction with databases.  For this class, you can think of a **database** as a bunch of excel spreadsheets all sitting in one place.  Not all databases are a bunch of excel spreadsheets sitting in one place, but it is a reasonable idea for this class.\n\n# Why Do Data Analysts Use SQL?",

The five most apparent are:\n\n* SQL is easy to understand.\n* Traditional databases allow us to access data directly.\n* Traditional databases allow us to audit and replicate our data.\n* SQL is a great tool for analyzing multiple tables at once.\n* SQL allows you to analyze more complex questions than dashboard tools like Google Analytics.\n\nYou will experience these advantages first hand, as we learn to write SQL to interact with data.  \n\nI realize you might be getting a little nervous or anxious to start writing code.  This might even be the first time you have written in any sort of programming language.  I assure you, we will work through examples to help assure you feel supported the whole time to take on this new challenge!\n\n\n## SQL vs. NoSQL\n\nYou may have heard of NoSQL, which stands for not only SQL.  Databases using NoSQL allow for you to write code that interacts with the data a bit differently than what we will do in this course.  These NoSQL environments tend to be particularly popular for web based data, but less popular for data that lives in spreadsheets the way we have been analyzing data up to this point.  One of the most popular NoSQL languages is called [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).  Udacity has a full course on MongoDB that you can take for free [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-wrangling-with-mongodb--ud032), but these will not be a focus of this program.  \n\nNoSQL is not a focus of analyzing data in this Nanodegree program, but you might see it referenced outside this course!",

In this course we will use [**Postgres**](https://www.postgresql.org/) within the classroom, which is a popular open-source database with a very complete library of analytical functions. \n\nSome of the most popular databases include:\n1. MySQL\n2. Access\n3. Oracle\n4. Microsoft SQL Server\n5. Postgres\n \nYou can also write SQL within other programming frameworks like Python, Scala, and HaDoop.  \n\n### Small Differences\n\nEach of these SQL databases may have subtle differences in syntax and available functions -- for example, MySQL doesn’t have some of the functions for modifying dates as Postgres. **Most** of what you see with Postgres will be directly applicable to using SQL in other frameworks and database environments.  For the differences that do exist, you should check the documentation.  Most SQL environments have great documentation online that you can easily access with a quick Google search.\n\nThe article [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/sqlite-vs-mysql-vs-postgresql-a-comparison-of-relational-database-management-systems) compares three of the most common types of SQL: SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. \n\nYou will use PostgreSQL for the lessons in this course, but you are not required to download it to your machine. We provide SQL workspaces in the classroom throughout the lessons. You may download PostgreSQL [here](https://www.postgresql.org/) if you'd like though.\n\nSo with that, let's jump in!\n",

You can begin typing right next to the number 1.  \n```\nSELECT *\nFROM orders;\n```\nOnce you have  typed in your SQL code, you can click on the blue **EVALUATE** button to run the query.  This may take a moment.  An alternative to clicking EVALUATE is to use **control + Enter** to execute your query.  If you get an error, it will sometimes cover the EVALUATE button, so this second option is very nice!\n\nYou will notice that your instructor Derek uses \"demo\" tables, like `FROM demo.orders` (and he will continue to do this in future lessons), but you should write your queries using the table names exactly as shown in the Schema on the left, with \"demo\" removed, like `FROM orders`.  \n\n\n\n### SELECT and FROM in Every SQL Query\n\nEvery query will have at least a **SELECT** and  **FROM** statement.  The **SELECT** statement is where you put the **columns** for which you would like to show the data.  The **FROM** statement is where you put the **tables** from which you would like to pull data.\n\n### Your Turn\n\nTry writing your own query to select only the `id`, `account_id`, and `occurred_at` columns for all orders in the **orders** table.<br>\n\n\n### Checking the Output of your Query\nIf you see an error message after executing your query, no problem! Programmers get errors all the time! Mistakes are opportunities to learn. :)\n\nJust take a look at what the error says, check the syntax of your query compared to your notes or what was shown in the lesson video or text, make revisions, and try it again. See what you can learn from your mistake, and make a note about it.\n\nIf you see a message saying \"Success!\" this means you had no syntax errors and your query executed well. It does not necessarily mean that you got your desired results though! It is still up to you to examine your output and see if what you got was what you wanted. \n\nYou can also check on the next page after each quiz, to see how your query compares to the solution that we provide. We highly recommend that you try writing your query first, before looking at any solution. :)\n\n\n\n##### Downloading the Schema Tables\n(In some versions of this lesson, you might be able to download the Parch & Posey database to your computer from the Resources tab in the left sidebar of your classroom, but this is not necessary for you to do at all.)",

              "text": "In case you want to test any of the ideas below, I have embedded a SQL workspace environment at the bottom of this page.\n\n# Formatting Your Queries\n\n### Using Upper and Lower Case in SQL\n\nSQL queries can be run successfully whether characters are written in upper- or lower-case. In other words, SQL queries are not case-sensitive.  The following query:\n\n```\nSELECT account_id\nFROM orders\n```\nis the same as:\n\n```\nselect account_id\nfrom orders\n```\n\nwhich is also the same as:\n\n```\nSeLeCt AcCoUnt_id\nFrOm oRdErS\n```\n\n**However**, you may have noticed that we have been capitalizing SELECT and FROM, while we leave table and column names in lower case. This is because even though SQL is case-insensitive, **it is common and best practice to capitalize all SQL commands, like SELECT and FROM, and keep everything else in your query lower case.**\n\nCapitalizing command words makes queries easier to read, which will matter more as you write more complex queries.  For now, it is just a good habit to start getting into, to make your SQL queries more readable.\n\nOne other note: The text data stored in SQL tables can be either upper or lower case, and SQL *is* case-sensitive in regard to this text data.\n\n\n### Avoid Spaces in Table and Variable Names\nIt is common to use underscores and avoid spaces in column names.  It is a bit annoying to work with spaces in SQL.  In Postgres if you have spaces in column or table names, you need to refer to these columns/tables with double quotes around them (Ex: FROM \"Table Name\" as opposed to FROM table_name). In other environments, you might see this as square brackets instead (Ex: FROM [Table Name]).\n\n### Use White Space in Queries\nSQL queries ignore spaces, so you can add as many spaces and blank lines between code as you want, and the queries are the same. This query\n\n```\n SELECT account_id FROM orders\n```\nis equivalent to this query:\n```\nSELECT account_id\nFROM orders\n```\nand this query (but please don't ever write queries like this):\n```\nSELECT              account_id\n\nFROM               orders\n```\n\n\n### Semicolons\n\nDepending on your SQL environment, your query may need a semicolon at the end to execute.  Other environments are more flexible in terms of this being a  \"requirement.\"  It is considered best practice to put a semicolon at the end of each statement, which also allows you to run multiple queries at once if your environment allows this.\n\nBest practice:\n\n```\nSELECT account_id\nFROM orders;\n```\n\nSince our environment here doesn't require it, you will see solutions written without the semicolon:\n\n```\nSELECT account_id\nFROM orders\n```\n\n### Phew!!! That was a lot of rules. Let's just write some queries.  You will make mistakes, but that is part of the learning process!\n",

If you are familiar with Excel or Google Sheets, using **ORDER BY** is similar to sorting a sheet using a column. A key difference, however, is that **using ORDER BY in a SQL query only has temporary effects, for the results of that query, unlike sorting a sheet by column in Excel or Sheets.** \n\nIn other words, when you use ORDER BY in a SQL query, your output will be sorted that way, but then the next query you run will encounter the unsorted data again. It's important to keep in mind that this is different than using common spreadsheet software, where sorting the spreadsheet by column actually alters the data in that sheet until you undo or change that sorting. This highlights the meaning and function of a SQL \"query.\"\n\nThe **ORDER BY** statement always comes in a query after the **SELECT** and **FROM** statements, but before the **LIMIT** statement. If you are using the **LIMIT** statement, it will always appear last. As you learn additional commands, the order of these statements will matter more.  \n\n### Pro Tip\n\nRemember `DESC` can be added after the column in your **ORDER BY** statement to sort in descending order, as the default is to sort in ascending order.\n",

Usually you want to give a name, or \"alias,\" to your new column using the **AS** keyword.\n\nThis derived column, and its alias, are generally only temporary, existing just for the duration of your query. The next time you run a query and access this table, the new column will not be there.\n\nIf you are deriving the new column from existing columns using a mathematical expression, then these familiar mathematical operators will be useful:\n\n1. `*` (Multiplication)\n2. `+` (Addition)\n3. `-` (Subtraction)\n4. `/` (Division)\n\nConsider this example:\n```\nSELECT id, (standard_amt_usd/total_amt_usd)*100 AS std_percent, total_amt_usd\nFROM orders\nLIMIT 10;\n```\nHere we divide the standard paper dollar amount by the total order amount to find the standard paper percent for the order, and use the **AS** keyword to name this new column \"std_percent.\" You can run this query on the next page if you'd like, to see the output.\n\n## Order of Operations\nRemember PEMDAS from math class to help remember the order of operations? If not, check out this [link](http://www.purplemath.com/modules/orderops.htm) as a reminder.  The same order of operations applies when using arithmetic operators in SQL. \n\nThe following two statements have very different end results:\n1. **Standard_qty / standard_qty + gloss_qty + poster_qty** \n2. **standard_qty / (standard_qty + gloss_qty + poster_qty)**\n\nIt is likely that you mean to do the calculation as written in statement number 2!\n",

Limit the results to the first 10 orders, and include the `id` and `account_id` fields.  <br><br>  \n\n2. Write a query that finds the percentage of revenue that comes from poster paper for each order.  You will need to use only the columns that end with `_usd`.  (Try to do this without using the `total` column.) Display the `id` and `account_id` fields also.\n **NOTE - you will receive an error with the correct solution to this question.  This occurs because at least one of the values in the data creates a division by zero in your formula.  You will learn later in the course how to fully handle this issue. For now, you can just limit your calculations to the first 10 orders, as we did in question #1, and you'll avoid that set of data that causes the problem.** <br><br>\n\nNotice, the above operators combine information across columns for the same row.

The `%` tells us that we might want any number of characters leading up to a particular set of characters or following a certain set of characters, as we saw with the **google** syntax above.  Remember you will need to use single quotes for the text you pass to the **LIKE** operator, because of this lower and uppercase letters are not the same within the string.  Searching for **'T'** is not the same as searching for **'t'**.  In other SQL environments (outside the classroom), you can use either single or double quotes.\n\nHopefully you are starting to get more comfortable with SQL, as we are starting to move toward operations that have more applications, but this also means we can't show you every use case.  Hopefully, you can start to think about how you might use these types of applications to identify phone numbers from a certain region, or an individual where you can't quite remember the full name.  \n\n",

Each time you link a new statement with an **OR**, you will need to specify the column you are interested in looking at.  You may link as many statements as you would like to consider at the same time.  This operator works with all of the operations we have seen so far including arithmetic operators (`+`, `*`, `-`, `/`), **LIKE**, **IN**, **NOT**, **AND**, and **BETWEEN** logic can all be linked together using the **OR** operator.\n\nWhen combining multiple of these operations, we frequently might need to use parentheses to assure that logic we want to perform is being executed correctly.

Let's take a moment to recap all that we have covered before moving on:\n\n\n\n|**Statement**   | **How to Use It**  | **Other Details**|\n|---|---|---|\n|   SELECT| SELECT **Col1**, **Col2**, ...  | Provide the columns you want |\n|   FROM |  FROM **Table** | Provide the table where the columns exist\n|  LIMIT | LIMIT **10 **   | Limits based number of rows returned\n| ORDER BY  | ORDER BY **Col**  | Orders table based on the column.  Used with **DESC**.\n| WHERE  | WHERE **Col > 5**  | A conditional statement to filter your results \n| LIKE  | WHERE **Col LIKE '%me%'**  | Only pulls rows where column has 'me' within the text \n| IN  | WHERE **Col IN ('Y', 'N')**  | A filter for only rows with column of 'Y' or 'N'\n| NOT  | WHERE **Col NOT IN ('Y', 'N')**  | **NOT** is frequently used with **LIKE** and **IN**\n| AND | WHERE **Col1 > 5 AND Col2 < 3 **  | Filter rows where two or more conditions must be true \n| OR  | WHERE **Col1 > 5 OR Col2 < 3**  | Filter rows where at least one condition must be true\n| BETWEEN | WHERE **Col BETWEEN 3 AND 5**  | Often easier syntax than using an **AND**\n\n### Other Tips\n\nThough SQL is **not case sensitive** (it doesn't care if you write your statements as all uppercase or lowercase), we discussed some best practices.  **The order of the key words does matter!**  Using what you know so far, you will want to write your statements as:\n\n```\nSELECT col1, col2\nFROM table1\nWHERE col3  > 5 AND col4 LIKE '%os%'\nORDER BY col5\nLIMIT 10;\n```\n\nNotice, you can retrieve different columns than those being used in the **ORDER BY** and **WHERE** statements.  Assuming all of these column names existed in this way (`col1`, `col2`, `col3`, `col4`, `col5`) within a table called `table1`, this query would run just fine.\n\n\n# Looking Ahead\n\nIn the next lesson, you will be learning about **JOIN**s.  This is the real secret (well not really a secret) behind the success of SQL as a language.  **JOIN**s allow us to combine multiple tables together.  All of the operations we learned here will still be important moving forward, but we will be able to answer much more complex questions by combining information from multiple tables!   You have already mastered so much - potentially writing your first code ever, but it is about to get so much better!",
