        "description": "CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. After nearly 32,000 letters were sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. With nearly *15 million* working Californians, CharityML has brought you on board to help build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail. Your goal will be evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent. \n\n### Evaluation\nYour project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the **<a href=\"https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/406/view\" target=\"_blank\">Finding Donors for CharityML project rubric</a>**. Be sure to review this rubric thoroughly and self-evaluate your project before submission. All criteria found in the rubric must be *meeting specifications* for you to pass.\n\n### Submission Files\nWhen you are ready to submit your project, collect the following files and compress them into a single archive for upload. Alternatively, you may supply the following files on your GitHub Repo in a folder named `finding_donors` for ease of access:\n - The `finding_donors.ipynb` notebook file with all questions answered and all code cells executed and displaying output.\n - An **HTML** export of the project notebook with the name **report.html**. This file *must* be present for your project to be evaluated.\n\n## Project Submission Checklist\n\n**Before submitting your project, please review and confirm the following items.** \n<input type=\"checkbox\"> I am confident all rubric items have been met and my project will pass as submitted. \n<input type=\"checkbox\"> Project builds correctly without errors and runs.\n<input type=\"checkbox\"> All required functionality exists and my project behaves as expected per the project's specifications.\n\n**Once you have checked all these items, you are ready to submit!**\n\n\n### I'm Ready!\nWhen you're ready to submit your project, click on the **Submit Project** button at the bottom of the page.\n\n### What's Next?\nYou will get an email as soon as your reviewer has feedback for you. In the meantime, review your next project and feel free to get started on it or the courses supporting it!",

It is important in machine learning to understand exactly when and where a certain algorithm should be used, and when one should be avoided.\n\nThings you will learn by completing this project:\n- How to identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.\n- How to establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.\n- What each of several supervised learning algorithms accomplishes given a specific dataset.\n- How to investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.",

You'll load this data in the notebook.\n- `visuals.py`: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project. Do not modify.\n\nIn the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the folder on your machine where you've put the project files, and then use the command `jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb` to open up a browser window or tab to work with your notebook. Alternatively, you can use the command `jupyter notebook` or `ipython notebook` and navigate to the notebook file in the browser window that opens. Follow the instructions in the notebook and answer each question presented to successfully complete the project. A **README** file has also been provided with the project files which may contain additional necessary information or instruction for the project. \n",
