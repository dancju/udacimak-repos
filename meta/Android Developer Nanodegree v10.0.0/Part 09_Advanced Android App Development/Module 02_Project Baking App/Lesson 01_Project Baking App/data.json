This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.\n\n# Why this Project?\nAs a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app. Unlike Popular Movies where we gave you an implementation guide, it will be up to you to figure things out for the Baking App. \n\n# What Will I Learn?\nIn this project you will:\n* Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.\n* Handle error cases in Android.\n* Add a widget to your app experience.\n* Leverage a third-party library in your app.\n* Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.\n\n# App Description\nYour task is to create a Android Baking App that will allow Udacity’s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. You will create an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.\n\n<a href=\"http://go.udacity.com/android-baking-app-json\" target=\"_blank\">The recipe listing is located here</a>.\n\nThe JSON file contains the recipes' instructions, ingredients, videos and images you will need to complete this project. Don’t assume that all steps of the recipe have a video. Some may have a video, an image, or no visual media at all. \n\nOne of the skills you will demonstrate in this project is how to handle unexpected input in your data -- professional developers often cannot expect polished JSON data when building an app.\n\nClick \"Next\" to see some sample mocks for the app!",
