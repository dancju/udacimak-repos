However, some deep learning applications require analysis of large image datasets or training over many epochs to work well, and in this case, you can use a GPU to greatly speed up the training process. A [GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit) is a type of processor that supports greater parallelism.\n\nIn this course, you will need to use a GPU to train an image captioning system, which includes a complex architecture and large amounts of training data, but, **you will be given a GPU-enabled workspace to do this training**. So, you are not required to create a GPU instance for local use.\n\nIf you do choose to develop locally or work on complex, deep learning side projects of your own, learning how to setup a GPU instance can be very useful, which is what this lesson is all about!\n\n> If you do not already have a computer with a built-in NVIDIA GPU, you can use an [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance.

Choose an Instance Type -  Instance Type offers varying combinations of CPUs, memory (GB), storage (GB), types of network performance, and availability of IPv6 support. AWS offers a variety of Instance Types, broadly categorized in 5 categories. You can choose an Instance Type that fits our use case. The specific type of GPU instance you should launch for this tutorial is called __“p2.xlarge”__.\n3. Configure Instance Details - Provide the instance count and configuration details, such as, network, subnet, behavior, monitoring, etc. \n4. Add Storage - You can choose to attach either *SSD* or *Standard Magnetic* drive to your instance. \n5. Add Tags - A tag serves as a *label* that you can attach to multiple AWS resources, such as volumes, instances or both. \n6. Configure Security Group - Attach a set of firewall rules to your instance(s) that controls the incoming traffic to your instance(s). \n7.
