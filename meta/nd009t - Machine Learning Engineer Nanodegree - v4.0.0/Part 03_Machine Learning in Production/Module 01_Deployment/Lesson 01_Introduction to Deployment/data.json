Then in the upcoming lessons, you will put these ideas to practice by using [Amazon's SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/). SageMaker is just *one* method for deploying machine learning models.\n\nSpecifically in this lesson, we will look at answering the following questions:\n\n1. What's the *machine learning workflow*?<br><br>\n2. How does ***deployment*** fit into the *machine learning workflow*?<br><br>\n3. What is *cloud computing*?<br><br>\n4. Why would we use *cloud computing* for ***deploying*** machine learning models?<br><br>\n5. Why isn't ***deployment*** a part of many machine learning curriculums?<br><br>\n6. What does it mean for a model to be ***deployed***?<br><br>\n7. What are the *essential* characteristics associated with the code of *deployed models*?<br><br>\n8. What are *different* cloud computing platforms we might use to ***deploy*** our machine learning models?\n\nAt the end of this lesson, you'll understand the broader idea of ***machine learning deployment***.  Then Sean will be guiding you through using [SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) to *deploy* your own machine learning models.  This is a lot to cover, but by the end you will have a general idea of *all* the concepts related to *deploying machine learning models* into real world *production systems*.",

              "text": "### Cloud Computing\n\nIn this section, we will focus on answering two questions:\n\n* What is cloud computing?\n* Why would a business decide to use cloud computing?\n\nThis section will be a high-level look.  However, you can dive more into the details by looking at the *optional pages* added at the end of this section.\n\n### What is cloud computing?\n\nYou can think of **cloud computing** as transforming an *IT product* into an *IT service*.  \n\nConsider the following example:\n<p style=\"margin-left: 25px\">Have you ever had to backup and store important files on your computer? Maybe these files are family photos from your last vacation. You might store these photos on a *flash drive*.  These days you have an *alternative option* to store these photos in the ***cloud*** using a *cloud storage provider*, like: [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/), [Apple’s iCloud](https://www.apple.com/icloud/), or [Microsoft’s OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/). \n</p>\n\n**Cloud computing** can simply be thought of as transforming an *Information Technology (IT) product* into a *service*. With our vacation photos example, we transformed storing photos on an *IT product*, the ***flash drive***; into storing them *using a service*, like ***Google Drive***.\n\nUsing a *cloud storage service* provides the ***benefits*** of making it *easier to access* and *share* your vacation photos, because you no longer need the flash drive. You’ll only need a device with an internet connection to *access* your photos and to grant permission to *others to access* your photos.\n\nGenerally, think of **cloud computing** as using an internet connected device to log into a *cloud computing service*, like ***Google Drive***, to access an *IT resource*, your vacation ***photos***. These *IT resources*, your vacation ***photos***, are stored in the *cloud provider’s* ***data center***. Besides cloud storage, other cloud services include: cloud applications, databases, virtual machines, and other services like SageMaker.\n\n### Why would a business decide to use cloud computing?\n\nMost of the factors related to choosing *cloud computing services*, instead of *developing on-premise IT resources* are related to ***time*** and ***cost***.  The ***capacity utilization*** graph *below* shows how *cloud computing* compares to *traditional infrastructure* (on-premise IT resources) in meeting *customer demand*.  \n\n***Capacity*** in the graph *below* can be thought of as the *IT resources* like: compute capacity, storage, and networking, that's needed to meet customer demand for a business' products and the ***costs*** associated with those *IT resources*. In our vacation photos example, *customer demand* is for storing and sharing customer photos.  The *IT resources* are the required software and hardware that enables photo storage and sharing in the *cloud* or *on-premise* (traditional infrastructure).\n\nLooking at the graph, notice that *traditional infrastructure* doesn't scale when there are spikes in demand, and also leaves excess when preparing for *future* demand.  This ability to easily meet unstable, fluctuating *customer demand* illustrates many of the benefits of *cloud computing*.",

Summarized below are the ***benefits*** of cloud computing that are often what *drives* businesses to include cloud services in their IT infrastructure [**1**]. These same ***benefits*** are echoed in those provided by cloud providers Amazon ([benefits](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/)), Google ([benefits](https://cloud.google.com/what-is-cloud-computing/)), and Microsoft ([benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-cloud-computing/)). \n\n#### Benefits\n\n1. Reduced Investments and Proportional Costs (providing cost reduction)<br><br>\n2. Increased Scalability (providing simplified capacity planning)<br><br>\n3. Increased Availability and Reliability (providing organizational agility)<br><br>\n\nBelow we have also summarized he ***risks*** associated with cloud computing [**1**]. Cloud providers don't typically highlight the *risks* assumed when using their cloud services like they do with the *benefits*, but cloud providers like: Amazon ([security](https://aws.amazon.com/security/introduction-to-cloud-security/)), Google ([security](https://cloud.google.com/security/data-safety/)), and Microsoft ([security](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/CloudServices/Azure/default.aspx)) often provide details on security of their cloud services.  It's up to the *cloud user* to understand the compliance and legal issues associated with housing data within a *cloud provider's* data center instead of on-premise. The service level agreements (SLA) provided for a cloud service often highlight security responsibilities of the cloud provider and those *assumed* by the cloud user.\n\n#### Risks\n\n1. (Potential) Increase in Security Vulnerabilities <br><br>\n2. Reduced Operational Governance Control (over cloud resources)<br><br>\n3. Limited Portability Between Cloud Providers<br><br>\n4.

              "text": "### Deployment to Production\n\n##### Recall that:\n<p style=\"margin-left: 25px\">***Deployment to production*** can simply be thought of as a method that integrates a machine learning model into an existing production environment so that the model can be used to make *decisions* or *predictions* based upon *data input* into the model. </p>\n\nThis means that moving from *modeling* to *deployment*, a *model* needs to be provided to those responsible for *deployment*. We are going to assume that the machine learning model we will be deploying was developed in Python. \n\n### Paths to Deployment\nThere are *three* primary methods used to transfer a model from the ***modeling*** *component* to the ***deployment*** *component* of the machine learning workflow. We will be discussing them in *order* of ***least*** to ***most*** commonly used. The ***third*** *method* that's *most* similar to what’s used for *deployment* within ***Amazon’s SageMaker***.\n\n#### Paths to *Deployment*:\n1. Python model is *recoded* into the programming language of the production environment.   \n&nbsp; \n2. Model is *coded* in *Predictive Model Markup Language* (PMML) or *Portable Format Analytics* (PFA).  \n&nbsp; \n3. Python model is *converted* into a format that can be used in the production environment.   \n&nbsp; \n\n#### Recoding Model into Programming Language of Production Environment\nThe *first* method which involves recoding the Python model into the language of the production environment, often Java or C++. This method is *rarely used anymore* because it takes time to recode, test, and validate the model that provides the *same* predictions as the *original*.\n\n#### Model is Coded in PMML or PFA\nThe *second* method is to code the model in Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) or Portable Format for Analytics (PFA), which are two complementary standards that *simplify *moving predictive models to *deployment* into a *production environment*. The Data Mining Group developed both PMML and PFA to provide vendor-neutral executable model specifications for certain predictive models used by data mining and machine learning. Certain analytic software allows for the direct import of PMML including but *not limited* to IBM SPSS, R, SAS Base & Enterprise Miner, Apache Spark, Teradata Warehouse Miner, and TIBCO Spotfire.\n\n#### Model is Converted into Format that’s used in the Production Environment\nThe *third* method is to build a Python model and ***use*** *libraries* and *methods* that *convert* the model into ***code*** that can be used in the *production environment*. Specifically *most* popular machine learning software frameworks, like PyTorch, TensorFlow, SciKit-Learn, have methods that will *convert* Python models into *intermediate standard format*, like ONNX ([Open Neural Network Exchange](https://onnx.ai/) format). This *intermediate standard format* then can be ***converted*** into the software native to the *production environment*. \n- This is the *easiest* and *fastest* way ***to move*** a Python model from *modeling* directly to *deployment*.\n- Moving forward this is *typically* the way *models* are ***moved*** into the *production environment*. \n- Technologies like *containers*, *endpoints*, and *APIs* (Application Programming Interfaces) also help ***ease*** the ***work*** required for *deploying* a model into the *production environment*. \n\nWe will discuss these *technologies* in more detail in the ***next*** sections. \n\n\n### Machine Learning Workflow and DevOps",

The *modeling* **can’t** occur without *first* having the *data* the model will be based upon *prepared* for the modeling process. \n\nComparatively *deployment* is **more** tightly coupled with the *production environment* than with *modeling* or *exploring and processing the data*. Therefore, *traditionally* there’s was a separation between *Deployment* and the *other components* of the machine learning workflow. Specifically looking at the diagram ***above***, the **Process Data and Modeling** are considered ***Development***; whereas, **Deployment** is *typically* considered ***Operations***. \n\nIn the past typically, ***development*** was handled by **analysts**; whereas, ***operations*** was handled by **software developers** responsible for the *production environment*. With *recent* developments in *technology* (containers, endpoints, APIs) and the *most* common path of deployment; *this division* between ***development*** and ***operations*** *softens*. The softening of this division enables **analysts** to handle certain aspects of ***deployment*** and enables faster updates to faltering models.\n\n#### Deployment within Machine Learning Curriculum\n***Deployment*** is **not** commonly included in *machine learning curriculum*. This likely is associated with the *analyst's* typical focus on ***Exploring and Processing Data*** and ***Modeling***, and the *software developer's* focusing more on ***Deployment*** and the *production environment*.  Advances in cloud services, like [SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) and [ML Engine](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/), and deployment technologies, like Containers and REST APIs, allow for *analysts* to easily take on the responsibilities of ***deployment***.\n",

              "text": "### Model, Application, and Containers\nWhen we discussed the *production environment*, it was composed of two primary programs, the **model** and the **application**, that *communicate* with each other through the **endpoint** (***interface***). \n- The **model** is simply the *Python model* that's created, trained, and evaluated in the ***Modeling*** component of the *machine learning workflow*. \n- The **application** is simply a *web* or *software application* that *enables* the application users to use the *model* to retrieve *predictions*. \n\nBoth the **model** and the **application** require a *computing environment* so that they can be run and available for use. One way to *create* and *maintain* these *computing environments* is through the use of ***containers***.\n- Specifically, the **model** and the **application** can each be run in a ***container*** *computing environment*. The ***containers*** are created using a ***script*** that contains instructions on which software packages, libraries, and other computing attributes are needed in order to run a *software application*, in our case either the **model** or the **application**.   \n\n#### Containers Defined\n- A ***container*** can be thought of as a *standardized collection/bundle of software* that is to be *used* for the specific purpose of *running an application*. \n\nAs stated **above** ***container*** *technology* is *used to create* the **model** and **application** *computational environments* associated with ***deployment*** in machine learning. A common **container** software is *Docker*. Due to its popularity sometimes *Docker* is used synonymously with **containers**.\n\n#### Containers Explained\nOften to first explain the concept of ***containers***, people tend to use the analogy of how Docker *containers* are similar to shipping containers. \n- Shipping containers can contain a wide variety of products, from food to computers to cars. \n- The structure of a shipping container provides the ability for it to hold *different types* of products while making it *easy* to track, load, unload, and transport products worldwide within a shipping container. \n\nSimilarly *Docker* **containers**:\n- Can *contain* ***all*** types of *different* software.\n- The structure of a *Docker* **container** enables the **container** to be *created*, *saved*, *used*, and *deleted* through a set of *common tools*. \n- The *common tool set* works with ***any*** **container** regardless of the software the **container** contains. \n\n#### Container Structure\nThe image **below** shows the basic structure of a **container**, you have:\n- The underlying *computational infrastructure* which can be: a cloud provider’s data center, an on-premise data center, or even someone’s local computer. \n- Next, you have an *operating system* running on this computational infrastructure, this could be the operating system on your local computer. \n- Next, there’s the *container engine*, this could be *Docker* software running on your local computer. The *container engine* software enables one to create, save, use, and delete containers; for our example, it could be *Docker* running on a local computer. \n- The final two layers make up the composition of the *containers*. \n - The first layer of the container is the *libraries* and *binaries* required to launch, run, and maintain the *next* layer, the *application* layer.\n- The image **below** shows *three* containers running *three* different applications. \n\nThis *architecture* of **containers** provides the following *advantages*:\n1. Isolates the application, which *increases* security.     \n&nbsp; \n2. Requires *only* software needed to run the application, which uses computational resources *more efficiently* and allows for faster application deployment.     \n&nbsp; \n3. Makes application creation, replication, deletion, and maintenance easier and the same across all applications that are deployed using containers.     \n&nbsp; \n4. Provides a more simple and secure way to replicate, save, and share containers.       \n&nbsp; \n",

              "text": "### Characteristics of Deployment \n#### Model Versioning\n\nOne characteristic of deployment is the **version** of the model that is to be deployed.\n- Besides saving the **model version** as a part of a *model’s metadata* in a database, the *deployment platform* should allow one to indicate a deployed **model’s version**. \n\nThis will make it easier to maintain, monitor, and update the *deployed model*.\n\n#### Model Monitoring \nAnother characteristic of deployment is the ability to easily **monitor** your deployed models. \n- Once a model is deployed you will want to make certain it continues to meet its performance metrics; otherwise, the application may need to be updated with a *better* performing model. \n\n#### Model Updating and Routing\nThe ability to easily **update** your deployed model is another characteristic of deployment. \n- If a deployed model is *failing* to meet its performance metrics, it's likely you will need to **update** this model.\n\nIf there's been a *fundamental change* in the *data* that’s being input into the model for predictions; you'll want to **collect** this *input data* to be used to **update** the model.\n\n- The *deployment platform* should support **routing** *differing* proportions of *user requests* to the deployed models; to allow *comparison* of performance between the deployed model *variants*. \n\n**Routing** in this way allows for a test of a model *performance* as *compared* to other model *variants*.\n\n#### Model Predictions\nAnother characteristic of deployment is the *type* of **predictions** provided by your deployed model. There are *two common* types of **predictions**:\n- **On-demand predictions** \n- **Batch predictions**\n\n\n#### On-Demand Predictions\n- **On-demand predictions** might also be *called*:\n - online,\n - real-time, or \n - synchronous predictions\n- With these type of predictions, one *expects*: \n - a *low latency* of response to each prediction request, \n - but allows for possibility *high variability* in request volume. \n- Predictions are returned in the response from the request. Often these requests and responses are done through an API using JSON or XML formatted strings. \n\n\n- Each prediction request from the user can contain *one* or *many* requests for predictions. Noting that *many* is limited based upon the *size* of the data sent as the request. Common cloud platforms **on-demand prediction** request size limits can range from *1.5(ML Engine)* to *5 Megabytes (SageMaker)*. \n\n**On-demand predictions** are commonly used to provide customers, users, or employees with real-time, online responses based upon a deployed model. Thinking back on our *magic eight ball web application* example, users of our web application *would be* making **on-demand prediction** requests. \n\n\n#### Batch Predictions\n- **Batch predictions** might also be *called*: \n - asynchronous, or \n - batch-based predictions. \n- With these type of predictions, one *expects*: \n - *high volume* of requests with more *periodic submissions* \n - so *latency* won’t be an issue. \n- Each batch request will point to specifically *formatted data file* of requests and will return the predictions to a file. Cloud services ***require*** these files will be *stored* in the cloud provider’s cloud. \n\n\n- Cloud services typically have *limits* to how much data they can process with each batch request based upon *limits* they impose on the *size of file* you can store in their cloud storage service. For example, *Amazon’s SageMaker* limits batch predictions requests to the size limit they enforce on an object in their S3 storage service. \n\n**Batch predictions** are *commonly* used to help make *business decisions*. For example, imagine a business uses a complex model to predict customer satisfaction across a number of their products and they need these *estimates* for a *weekly* report. This would require processing customer data through a **batch prediction** request on a *weekly basis*. \n",

In the *next* few lessons, you will learn how to use **Amazon's SageMaker** to *deploy* machine learning models. Therefore, we *focused* on providing *more* information on [Amazon's SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/). To allow for a comparison of features offered by [SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/), we also provide detailed information about [Google's ML Engine](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/) because it's *most* similar to **SageMaker**. \n\n## Amazon Web Services (AWS)\n[Amazon Web Services (AWS) SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/ ) is Amazon's cloud service that allows you to *build*, *train*, and *deploy* machine learning models. Some advantages to using Amazon's SageMaker service are the following:\n\n- **Flexibility in Machine Learning Software**: [SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) has the flexibility to enable the use of ***any*** programming language or software framework for building, training, and deploying machine learning models in **AWS**. For the details see the three methods of modeling within **SageMaker** **below**.\n - [Built-in Algorithms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/algos.html) - There are at least fifteen built-in algorithms that are easily used within SageMaker. Specifically, built-in algorithms for discrete classification or quantitative analysis using [linear learner](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/linear-learner.html) or [XGBoost](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/xgboost.html), item recommendations using [factorization machine](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/fact-machines.html), grouping based upon attributes using [K-Means](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/k-means.html), an algorithm for [image classification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/image-classification.html), and many other algorithms. \n - **Custom Algorithms** - There are different programming languages and software frameworks that can be used to develop custom algorithms which include: [PyTorch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pytorch.html), [TensorFlow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/tf.html), [Apache MXNet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/mxnet.html), [Apache Spark](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/apache-spark.html), and [Chainer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/chainer.html). \n - [Your Own Algorithms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms.html) - Regardless of the programming language or software framework, you can use your own algorithm when it **isn't** included within the *built-in* or *custom algorithms* **above**.\n- **Ability to Explore and Process Data within SageMaker**:  [SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) enables the use of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/nbi.html) to explore and process data, along with creation, training, validation, testing, and deployment of machine learning models. This notebook interface makes data exploration and documentation easier. \n\n\n-  **Flexibility in Modeling and Deployment**:\n[SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) provides a number of features and automated tools that make ***modeling*** and ***deployment*** easier.  For the details on these features within **SageMaker** see **below**.\n - [Automatic Model Tuning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/automatic-model-tuning.html): [SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) provides a feature that allows hyperparameter tuning to find the **best** version of the model for *built-in* and *custom algorithms*.  For built-in algorithms **SageMaker** also provides evaluation metrics to evaluate the performance of your models. \n - [Monitoring Models](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/monitoring-overview.html):  [SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) provides features that allow you to monitor your *deployed* models. Additionally with *model deployment*, one can choose *how much* traffic to route to *each* deployed model (model variant).  More information on routing traffic to model variants can be found  [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/API_ProductionVariant.html ) and [here]( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/API_CreateEndpointConfig.html) .\n - **Type of Predictions**:  [SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) by *default* allows for [On-demand](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ex1-test-model.html) type of predictions where *each* prediction *request* can contain *one* to *many* requests. **SageMaker** also allows for [Batch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/how-it-works-batch.html) predictions, and request *data* size limits are based upon S3 object size limits.\n",

Below we have highlighted some of the ***similarities*** and ***differences*** between these two cloud service platforms. \n\n- **Prediction Costs**: The ***primary difference*** between the two is how they handle predictions. With ***SageMaker*** *predictions*, you must leave resources running to provide predictions.  This enables *less* latency in providing predictions at the *cost* of paying for running *idle* services, if there are no (or few) prediction requests made while services are running.  With ***ML Engine*** *predictions*, one has the option to *not* leave resources running which reduces cost associated with *infrequent* or *periodic* requests. Using this has *more* latency associated with predictions because the resources are in a offline state until they receive a prediction request. The *increased* latency is associated to bringing resources back online, but one *only* pays for the time the resources are *in use*. To see more about [ML Engine pricing](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/pricing#node-hour) and [SageMaker pricing](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/pricing#node-hour).\n\n\n- **Ability to Explore and Process Data**: Another ***difference*** between **ML Engine** and **SageMaker** is the fact that *Jupyter Notebooks* are not available within **ML Engine**.  To use *Jupyter Notebooks* within **Google's Cloud Platform** (GCP), one would use [Datalab](https://cloud.google.com/datalab/docs/). **GCP** separates data exploration, processing, and transformation into other services.  Specifically, [Google's Datalab](https://cloud.google.com/datalab/docs/) can be used for data exploration and data processing, [Dataprep](https://cloud.google.com/dataprep/docs/) can be used to explore and transform raw data into clean data for analysis and processing, and [DataFlow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/) can be used to deploy batch and streaming data processing pipelines. Noting that **Amazon Web Services** (AWS), also have data processing and transformation pipeline services like [AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/) and [AWS Data Pipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/).\n\n\n- **Machine Learning Software**: The final ***difference*** is that [Google's ML Engine](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/ ) has *less* flexibility in available software frameworks for building, training, and deploying machine learning models in **GCP** as compared to **Amazon's SageMaker**.  For the details regarding the two available software frameworks for modeling within **ML Engine** see **below**.\n - [Google's TensorFlow](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/tensorflow/) is an open source machine learning framework that was originally developed by the Google Brain team. [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) can be used for creating, training, and deploying machine learning and deep learning models. [Keras](https://keras.io/) is a higher level API written in Python that runs on top of [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), that's easier to use and allows for faster development. GCP provides both [TensorFlow examples](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/tensorflow/samples) and a [Keras example](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/tensorflow/samples#census-keras).\n\n - [Google's Scikit-learn](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/scikit/) is an open source machine learning framework in Python that was originally developed as a Google Summer of Code project. [Scikit-learn](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/scikit/) and an [XGBoost Python package](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/index.html) can be used together for creating, training, and deploying machine learning models. In the in [Google's example](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/scikit/training-xgboost), [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/index.html) is used for modeling and [Scikit-learn](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/scikit/) is used for processing the data.\n\n\n\n-  **Flexibility in Modeling and Deployment**:\n[Google's ML Engine](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/ ) provides a number of features and automated tools that make ***modeling*** and ***deployment*** easier, ***similar*** to the those provided by **Amazon's SageMaker**.

Additionally [ML Engine](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/ ) provides methods that enable [managing runtime versions](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/tensorflow/versioning) and [managing models and jobs](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/tensorflow/managing-models-jobs).\n - **Type of Predictions**:  [ML Engine](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/ ) allows for [Online](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/tensorflow/online-predict)(*or On-demand*) type of predictions where *each* prediction *request* can contain *one* to *many* requests. **ML Engine** also allows for [Batch](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/tensorflow/batch-predict) predictions.

Cloud providers Amazon, Google, and Microsoft also provide more modern and evolving explanations of cloud computing, its service models, its deployment models, and its essential characteristics (see **4**, **5**, & **6** in **References**).

The customer’s responsibility is only to maintain their user account which typically includes: registration, login, administration, and customization of the software application they’re using as a service. \n\n### Platform as a Service\nWith *Platform as a Service*, PaaS, the yellow dashed line demonstrates that the customer gains additional responsibilities that are associated with managing all applications and data, such as including a user interface and dashboard, security, logs, and other features associated to the data and applications. \n\n\n",

              "text": "Different levels of security are automatically provided with each deployment model. Understanding deployment models are important in providing the appropriate level of security on the cloud services you use. The primary way to distinguish between different deployment models is by the group that’s provisioning the cloud services. With provisioning, we simply mean the group that’s providing the cloud services for their group’s use.\n\n### Public Cloud\nMost cloud deployment models offered by cloud providers, like Amazon Web Service or Google Cloud Platform, are public clouds. Public clouds are provisioned for use by the general public and they are the least secure of the deployment models. Because public clouds are the least secure, most providers allow customers to enable features that provide a “virtual private cloud” to increase the security on their public clouds.\n### Community Cloud\nAmazon Web Services’ GovCloud is an example of a community cloud. GovCloud customers are limited to US federal government employees, contractors, and agencies that have been granted access. Community clouds are more secure than public clouds because providers limiting access to community members and they isolate computing resources used by the community. A community cloud deployment model is provisioned by a specific community of customers from different organizations that have shared interests, like the US federal government in our GovCloud example. Shared interests may include a shared mission, security requirements, policies, and/or compliance considerations. \n\n### Private and Hybrid Clouds\nPrivate cloud deployment model is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization. Amazon Web Services offers a Virtual Private Cloud service, but this isn’t considered truly a private cloud unless customers enable additional features that isolate the hardware their cloud services are run on. A private cloud can be physically located on a company’s on-site data center or on a cloud provider’s data center. If the private cloud is provided by a cloud provider, then the private cloud services and infrastructure are always maintained on a private network with hardware and software dedicated solely to the customer’s organization. The hybrid clouds are simply composed of two or three of the different types of deployment model. ",

Your smartphone, tablet, computer use this broad network access to allow you to work remotely, check social media, reply to an email, and generally access the internet.  With our example of cloud storage, *Broad Network Access* is characterized by the ability to access the files you have stored with the cloud provider using any device that is connected to the internet. Noting that the cloud provider is responsible to ensure the path between the network and the data center.\n### Resource Pooling\n*Resource Pooling* allows the cloud provider’s computing capabilities to be pooled to serve multiple customers with different virtual resources that are dynamically assigned and re-assigned based upon customer demand. Using our example of cloud storage, *Resource Pooling* enables the cloud provider to supply storage services to many customers using their data center to store all their customers’ files. Additionally, the provider’s storage service must be able to handle any customer storing one to many files.\n### Rapid Elasticity\n*Rapid Elasticity* enables the cloud provider’s computing capabilities to be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly outward and inward proportional to customer demand. This ability to scale rapidly allows the cloud services to appear to have unlimited capabilities that can be used at any time for any quantity of demand. With our example of cloud storage, *Rapid Elasticity* provides the customer with the ability to store as many or as few files at any time. \n### Measured Service\n*Measured Service* allows the cloud provider’s system to automatically control and optimize resource usage by leveraging the system’s metering capability. Specifically, the cloud provider’s resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, which provides the necessary transparency for appropriately billing customers for cloud service usage. Using our example of cloud storage, *Measured Service* enables the cloud provider to charge a customer appropriately for storage space they are using to store their files.",

Below we have an example that explains *why* startups use cloud services.\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 25px\">Imagine it’s 2010 and you created a photo-sharing application called *Instagram*.  Some challenges you face are you have little funding, few employees, and your application will need to scale to meet customer usage. Ideally, your application needs to scale to meet spikes in demand without having to put limits on application usage or the number of supported users. Because you’re unsure about how popular your application will be, you don’t want to spend funding to prepare for users you may not have. Instead, you want to spend those funds on advertising and extra features to attract more users.  \n</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 25px\">You’ve learned cloud computing provides ***pay-as-you-go*** service (*on-demand self service*), that can be available to anyone with ***wireless or internet connection*** (*broad network access*), and can ***scale up and down rapidly*** (*rapid elasticity*) to meet customer demand easily. These ***features*** of **cloud computing** make using cloud the *obvious* choice to launch your photo sharing application.\n</p>\n\nWhile it may make sense why a startup like Instagram chose to use cloud services, it may be more perplexing why an *established* organization would consider incorporating cloud services into their infrastructure. Addressing these questions will provide you with information that will guide decisions you will make when ***deploying*** *machine learning models* within your workplace.\n\n### Capacity Utilization Graph\nTo understand why an *established* organization would consider incorporating cloud services into their infrastructure, it’s important to understand the ***capacity utilization over time graph*** below.  I’m going to explain this graph in detail to illustrate the business drivers and benefits of cloud computing for both *startups* and *established* organizations. \n",

              "text": "#### Axes \nAlong the y-axis or vertical axis of this graph is ***capacity***. Capacity can be thought of as a number of IT resources like compute capacity, storage, networking, etc. This ***capacity*** also includes the *costs* associated with these IT resources. For traditional non-cloud infrastructures, this would include purchase and maintenance of these resources. For cloud infrastructures, this would only include paying for use of these IT services. Along the x-axis or horizontal axis of this graph is ***time***. Generally, lines plotted on this graph depict ***capacity*** across ***time***.  \n\n#### Lines\nFor understanding this graph, we are going to return to our Instagram example. Imagine this graph depicts the ***capacity*** needed for Instagram’s photo-sharing application across a period of a few months. The **<span style=\"color:black;\">black</span>** curvy line depicts the *actual customer demand* for ***capacity*** based upon the customers’ usage of the photo-sharing application. The spikes in demand may indicate increased usage by registered Instagram users. The general rise in the **<span style=\"color:black;\">black</span>** curved line over time indicates an increase in the number of registered users of the Instagram application.\n\nThe *dashed* **<span style=\"color:#1155cc;\">blue</span>** line depicts the *predicted customer demand* for ***capacity*** based upon the predictions Instagram would have made if they would have decided to use traditional non-cloud infrastructure. Instagram would have had to base these predictions on historical data and current trends. \n\nThe **<span style=\"color:#1155cc;\">blue</span>** *step-like* line depicts how much ***capacity*** is provided by the *traditional non-cloud infrastructure* and hardware. If Instagram would have had decided to not use cloud services, this **<span style=\"color:#1155cc;\">blue</span>** *step-like* line would have been the capacity that Instagram would have provided their customers. In this scenario where Instagram is using *traditional infrastructure*, they would have needed to build or purchase their own data center and computing resources to provide capacity for their customers.\n\nThe **<span style=\"color:#f1c232;\">yellow</span>** curvy line depicts how much ***capacity*** Instagram would provide using *cloud infrastructure* to meet their customers’ demands for capacity. Notice that using cloud infrastructure will provide automated cloud capacity as a service. This automated cloud capacity enables a company the ability to meet and exceed customer demands, unlike if they had chosen to use *traditional non-cloud infrastructure*. \n\n### Interpretation of Graph \nWe explain the graph in detail to demonstrate the benefits of cloud infrastructure. With *traditional infrastructure*, it takes a considerable amount of time to predict demand, obtain approval for *capacity* increase, purchase new resources, and install these resources. The graph below depicts this lag of time with how *traditional infrastructure* is increased to the level of predicted ***future*** demand. The point select is the time at which they would be able to increase traditional infrastructure again.  \n\nIf Instagram had decided to use *traditional non-cloud infrastructure*, they would have needed more capital to make the investment in *traditional infrastructure* and they would have needed to overestimate customer demand for *capacity*. This overestimation of customer *capacity* provides Instagram with the additional time needed to upgrade *traditional infrastructure* to meet an increasing customer demand. \n\n#### Wasted Capacity\nThe **<span style=\"color:#00cfcf;\">cyan</span>** shaded area in this graph below depicts the amount of ***wasted capacity*** that Instagram would have had with *traditional non-cloud infrastructure* while they waited for customer demand to meet their *capacity*. Specifically, the **<span style=\"color:#1155cc;\">blue</span>** arrow shows the large costs associated with Instagram attempting to answer the variability in their customer demand for capacity by *overestimation* of demand using *traditional infrastructure*.",

              "text": "### Benefits of Cloud Computing\nThe ***capacity utilization*** graph above was initially used by cloud providers like Amazon to illustrate the ***benefits*** of cloud computing. Summarized below are the ***benefits*** of cloud computing which are often what *drives* businesses to include cloud services in their IT infrastructure [**1**]. These same ***benefits*** are echoed in those provided by cloud providers Amazon ([benefits](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/)), Google ([benefits](https://cloud.google.com/what-is-cloud-computing/)), and Microsoft ([benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-cloud-computing/)).  Additionally, these ***benefits*** are tightly coupled with what ***drives*** businesses to use cloud computing. In the sections below we explain these benefits and business drivers in greater detail.\n\n#### Benefits\n\n1. Reduced Investments and Proportional Costs (providing cost reduction)<br><br>\n2. Increased Scalability (providing simplified capacity planning)<br><br>\n3. Increased Availability and Reliability (providing organizational agility)<br><br>\n\n#### Reduced Investments and Proportional Costs\nUsing cloud computing has the benefit of ***reducing investments and having costs proportional*** to the usage of cloud services. Recall that cloud computing provides *on-demand* access to *pay-as-you-go* cloud computing services; therefore, reducing the necessity to invest in computational resources that will *not* be used. Additionally, *pay-as-you-go* services make using cloud resources proportional to their costs. This is illustrated by how *automated cloud capacity* can meet actual customer demand without *wasting capacity* nor having *insufficient capacity* to meet demand.  \n\nThe *automated* cloud capacity that always meets customer demand while minimizing *wasted capacity*, provides *cost savings*. Specifically, cloud computing provides this *direct alignment* between *cost* and *performance*, the minimization of *wasted capacity*, and the elimination of *insufficient capacity* which results in ***cost reduction***.  Additionally, there are also savings in removing the need to spend company resources on *prediction* of customer demand.  This ***cost reduction*** that's associated with the benefit of ***reducing investments and having proportional costs*** is typically considered a business ***driver*** of cloud computing.\n\n#### Increased Scalability\nCloud computing also provides the benefit of ***increased scalability***. This is also demonstrated by cloud capacity meeting customer demand. Using *automatic triggers* and the *rapid elasticity* provided by cloud computing enables consumers the ability to ensure that cloud capacity always ***exceeds*** customer demand by a small margin. \n\nCompanies, like Instagram, can utilize these *automated* features of cloud computing such that they can guarantee they meet their customer demand for *capacity* while minimizing *wasted capacity*, and reducing the need to spend company resources to *predict* customer demand.  These *automated* features of cloud computing *simplify* ***capacity planning*** for a business. This simplification of ***capacity planning*** that's associated with the benefit of ***increased scalability*** is typically considered a business ***driver*** of cloud computing.\n\n#### Increased Availability and Reliability\nThe final benefit is the ***increased availability and reliability*** provided by cloud computing. While *availability* and *reliability* can be provided by traditional infrastructure; these characteristics come natively with the ***automatic*** *on-demand self service*, *broad network access*, and *rapid elasticity* characteristics of cloud computing. Additionally, cloud providers provide guarantees associated with *availability* and *reliability* of their services in their service-level agreement, SLA. \n\nThis ***increased availability and reliability*** as depicted by *automated cloud capacity* (**<span style=\"color:#f1c232;\">yellow</span>** curvy line in the capacity utilization graph) illustrates how companies that use cloud computing can better adapt and evolve to respond to changes in customer demand as compared to traditional infrastructure (**<span style=\"color:#1155cc;\">blue</span>** step-like line in the capacity utilization graph). This ***increased availability and reliability*** provides a company with ***organizational agility*** that's typically considered a business ***driver*** of cloud computing.\n",

              "text": "## Risks of Cloud Computing\nTo understand the ***risks*** of cloud computing, recall the *essential characteristics* that compose the definition of cloud computing. Below we have also summarized he ***risks*** associated with cloud computing [**1**]. Cloud providers don't typically highlight the *risks* assumed when using their cloud services as they do with the *benefits*, but cloud providers like: Amazon ([security](https://aws.amazon.com/security/introduction-to-cloud-security/)), Google ([security](https://cloud.google.com/security/data-safety/)), and Microsoft ([security](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/CloudServices/Azure/default.aspx)) often provide details on security of their cloud services.  \n\nIt's up to the *cloud user* to understand the compliance and legal issues associated with housing data within a *cloud provider's* data center instead of on-premise. The service level agreements (SLA) provided for a cloud service often highlight security responsibilities of the cloud provider and those *assumed* by the cloud user. Below you will find the risks of cloud computing described in greater detail.\n\n#### Risks\n\n1. (Potential) Increase in Security Vulnerabilities <br><br>\n2. Reduced Operational Governance Control (over cloud resources)<br><br>\n3. Limited Portability Between Cloud Providers<br><br>\n4. Multi-regional Compliance and Legal Issues\n\n#### Increased Security Vulnerabilities\nConsider that to have *on-demand self service* with *broad network access* and *resource pooling*, one needs to *access* cloud services through the *internet*. Additionally, when cloud services utilize *resource pooling*, a customer might be using a ***shared*** cloud resource instead of a physically isolated resource. Cloud computing can have the ***risk*** of ***increased security vulnerabilities***; as compared to traditional infrastructure, which typically involves a direct connection to on-premise infrastructure with isolated resources. \n\n#### Reduced Operational Governance Control\nCloud computing has the ***risk*** of ***reduced operational governance control*** due to the *risks* associated with how the cloud providers operate their infrastructure and that they required external connections for communication between provider and customer. For example, a *disreputable* cloud provider could make guarantees in their cloud services’ service-level agreements that they *fail* to honor; therefore, making their customers ***unknowingly*** more *vulnerable*. Additionally, the cloud providers’ data centers might be located physically located much further from their customers than if their customer had opted to use traditional infrastructure. This *increased* physical distance could cause *variable latency* and *bandwidth* issues.\n\n#### Limited Portability Between Cloud Providers\nAnother ***risk*** of cloud computing is the ***limited portability between cloud providers***. The *lack* of an established industry *standard* could lead to customer ***dependency*** on particular cloud providers. Think about how difficult it is to share photos from a *Photo Stream* with those who don’t have iPhones, iPads, or other Apple devices.  It’s **not** *impossible*, but it isn’t simple and those without an Apple device *don’t* get the *same* functionality as those that have an Apple device. Similar can be said regarding most cloud platforms, it’s **not** *impossible* to move between cloud providers, but the transfer of data and code might not be seamless and certain providers may offer services of features that aren’t offered by other providers.\n\n#### Multiregional Compliance and Legal Issues\nThe final **risk** of cloud computing is the ***multiregional compliance and legal issues*** that may result from using cloud computing. Specifically, a cloud provider establishes their data centers in affordable and geographically convenient locations. The *physical location* of data centers can cause *legal concerns* connected to industry or *government regulations* that *specify* data privacy and storage policy. Additionally, there could be *legal issues* associated to *accessibility* and *disclosure* of data based upon the *country’s laws* where the data center is located. For example, consider how the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union is a much stronger data protection and *privacy regulation*than offered by the United States; therefore, US businesses must adhere to these stronger protections if they operate within the countries that are members of the European Union.\n",

Primarily because some of the efficiencies above *do not hold true* when there is existing computing infrastructure, some of the legacy architectures *might not* be able to be *integrated* with cloud services, some of the *risks* of cloud computing (security, governance, compliance) might outweigh expected the benefits of using cloud computing for the established organization, company culture *might not* be accepting of replacing traditional infrastructure with cloud, and company employees *may lack* the skill set to use cloud computing.\n\n\n## Cloud Computing Successes\nBelow we have provided examples of four companies (startup and established organizations) that embraced cloud computing to become successful.\n\n#### Instagram \nIn October 2010, the photo-sharing application called ***Instagram*** launched and:\n- within 1 day, it had 25,000 users\n- within 3 months,  it had 1 million users\n- within 1 and ½ years, it had close to 30 million users [**2**] \n\nFacebook purchased ***Instagram*** for an estimated $1 billion in April 2012 [**2**]. By September 2012, ***Instagram*** had 100 million users,  just shy of two years after their initial launch [**2**]. At the time of ***Instagram’s*** purchase company consisted of 13 employees and over 100 servers running in Amazon’s Web Service, AWS, to support 30 million users [**2**]. \n\n***Instagram*** had the luxury of starting from scratch and architecting for the cloud to start. To learn more about how ***Instagram*** migrated to AWS’s Virtual Private Cloud, see [here](https://instagram-engineering.com/migrating-from-aws-to-aws-f4b16a65e13c) - *10 minute read*.

In 2009, 100% of all streaming traffic was run through ***Netflix’s*** own data center [**2**]. By end of 2010, most of all that traffic was run through AWS data centers, with a goal of 95% of **all** services run through AWS [**2**]. ***Netflix*** made a business decision to move to the Cloud, they hired and trained an incredible engineering team to continue to be pioneers in cloud computing.  \n\nTo learn more about how ***Netflix*** use of AWS, see [here](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/netflix/) - *two videos 7 minutes total*.

Additionally, your workplace may also have already on-premise infrastructure that supports the machine learning workflow; therefore, making the use of cloud services an *unnecessary* expenditure. \n\n#### Typical Scenarios\nCloud services like Amazon’s SageMaker can be used for **all** parts of the Machine Learning Workflow  (***<span style=\"color:#1155cc;\">blue</span>*** *enclosed figure **above***); and with subsequent lessons you will be using Amazon's SageMaker in this *all cloud* scenario. Some users of SageMaker may decide to *Explore and Process Data* using on-premise (*non-cloud*) resources (***<span style=\"color:#f1c232;\">yellow</span>*** *enclosing the \"Explore & Process Data\"* ***below***). \n\nCloud services like Google’s Cloud ML Engine are meant to be used primarily for *Modeling* and *Deployment*.  It’s up to the user of Google's ML Engine if they would like to use on-premise (*non-cloud*) resources, Google’s Cloud Dataflow service, or other cloud services for the *Explore and Process Data* part of the Machine Learning Workflow.",

This might be a common strategy for organizations that are concerned about protecting the *privacy* of the data they used to create the model that was deployed.
