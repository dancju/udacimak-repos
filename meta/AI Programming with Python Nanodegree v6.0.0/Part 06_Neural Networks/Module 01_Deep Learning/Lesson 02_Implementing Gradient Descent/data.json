The network needs to make predictions as close as possible to the real values. To measure this, we use a metric of how wrong the predictions are, the **error**. A common metric is the sum of the squared errors (SSE):\n\n<div class=\"mathquill\">E = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\mu} \\sum_j \\left[ y^{\\mu}_j - \\hat{y} ^{\\mu}_j \\right]^2</div>\n\nwhere <span class=\"mathquill\">\\hat y</span> is the prediction and <span class=\"mathquill\">y</span> is the true value, and you take the sum over all output units <span class=\"mathquill\">j</span> and another sum over all data points <span class=\"mathquill\">\\mu</span>. This might seem like a really complicated equation at first, but it's fairly simple once you understand the symbols and can say what's going on in words. \n\nFirst, the inside sum over <span class=\"mathquill\">j</span>. This variable <span class=\"mathquill\">j</span> represents the output units of the network. So this inside sum is saying for each output unit, find the difference between the true value <span class=\"mathquill\">y</span> and the predicted value from the network <span class=\"mathquill\">\\hat y</span>, then square the difference, then sum up all those squares.\n\nThen the other sum over <span class=\"mathquill\">\\mu</span> is a sum over all the data points. So, for each data point you calculate the inner sum of the squared differences for each output unit. Then you sum up those squared differences for each data point. That gives you the overall error for all the output predictions for all the data points.",

Continuing the analogy, the error is our mountain and we want to get to the bottom. Since the fastest way down a mountain is in the steepest direction, the steps taken should be in the direction that minimizes the error the most. We can find this direction by calculating the *gradient* of the squared error.\n\n*Gradient* is another term for rate of change or slope. If you need to brush up on this concept, check out Khan Academy's [great lectures](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/multivariable-derivatives/gradient-and-directional-derivatives/v/gradient) on the topic.\n\n To calculate a rate of change, we turn to calculus, specifically derivatives. A derivative of a function <span class=\"mathquill\">f(x)</span> gives you another function <span class=\"mathquill\">f'(x)</span> that returns the slope of <span class=\"mathquill\">f(x)</span> at point <span class=\"mathquill\">x</span>. For example, consider <span class=\"mathquill\">f(x)=x^2</span>. The derivative of <span class=\"mathquill\">x^2</span> is <span class=\"mathquill\">f'(x) = 2x</span>. So, at <span class=\"mathquill\">x = 2</span>, the slope is <span class=\"mathquill\">f'(2) = 4</span>. Plotting this out, it looks like:",

We'll use a sigmoid function for the output unit activation. \n\n## Data cleanup\nYou might think there will be three input units, but we actually need to transform the data first. The `rank` feature is categorical, the numbers don't encode any sort of relative values. Rank 2 is not twice as much as rank 1, rank 3 is not 1.5 more than rank 2.  Instead, we need to use [dummy variables][1] to encode `rank`, splitting the data into four new columns encoded with ones or zeros. Rows with rank 1 have one in the rank 1 dummy column, and zeros in all other columns. Rows with rank 2 have one in the rank 2 dummy column, and zeros in all other columns. And so on.\n\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_variable_(statistics)\n\nWe'll also need to standardize the GRE and GPA data, which means to scale the values such that they have zero mean and a standard deviation of 1. This is necessary because the sigmoid function squashes really small and really large inputs. The gradient of really small and large inputs is zero, which means that the gradient descent step will go to zero too. Since the GRE and GPA values are fairly large, we have to be really careful about how we initialize the weights or the gradient descent steps will die off and the network won't train. Instead, if we standardize the data, we can initialize the weights easily and everyone is happy.\n\nThis is just a brief run-through, you'll learn more about preparing data later. If you're interested in how I did this, check out the `data_prep.py` file in the programming exercise below.\n\n",

Instead of the SSE, we're going to use the **mean** of the square errors (MSE). Now that we're using a lot of data, summing up all the weight steps can lead to really large updates that make the gradient descent diverge. To compensate for this, you'd need to use a quite small learning rate. Instead, we can just divide by the number of records in our data, <span class='mathquill'>m</span> to take the average. This way, no matter how much data we use, our learning rates will typically be in the range of 0.01 to 0.001.

              "text": "## Implementing with NumPy\n\nFor the most part, this is pretty straightforward with NumPy.\n\nFirst, you'll need to initialize the weights. We want these to be small such that the input to the sigmoid is in the linear region near 0 and not squashed at the high and low ends. It's also important to initialize them randomly so that they all have different starting values and diverge, breaking symmetry. So, we'll initialize the weights from a normal distribution centered at 0. A good value for the scale is <span class='mathquill'>1/\\sqrt{n}</span> where <span class='mathquill'>n</span> is the number of input units. This keeps the input to the sigmoid low for increasing numbers of input units.\n\n```python\nweights = np.random.normal(scale=1/n_features**.5, size=n_features)\n```\n\nNumPy provides a function `np.dot()` that calculates the dot product of two arrays, which conveniently calculates <span class='mathquill'>h</span> for us. The dot product multiplies two arrays element-wise, the first element in array 1 is multiplied by the first element in array 2, and so on. Then, each product is summed.\n\n```python\n# input to the output layer\noutput_in = np.dot(weights, inputs)\n```\n\nAnd finally, we can update <span class='mathquill'>\\Delta w_i</span> and <span class='mathquill'>w_i</span> by incrementing them with `weights += ...` which is shorthand for `weights = weights + ...`.\n\n### Efficiency tip!\nYou can save some calculations since we're using a sigmoid here. For the sigmoid function, <span class='mathquill'>f'(h) = f(h) (1 - f(h))</span>. That means that once you calculate <span class='mathquill'>f(h)</span>, the activation of the output unit, you can use it to calculate the gradient for the error gradient.",

Your goal here is to train the network until you reach a minimum in the mean square error (MSE) on the training set. You need to implement:\n\n* The network output: `output`.\n* The output error: `error`.\n* The error term: `error_term`.\n* Update the weight step: `del_w +=`.\n* Update the weights: `weights +=`.\n\nAfter you've written these parts, run the training by pressing \"Test Run\". The MSE will print out, as well as the accuracy on a test set, the fraction of correctly predicted admissions.\n\nFeel free to play with the hyperparameters and see how it changes the MSE.",

With multiple perceptrons, we are going to move to using vectors and matrices. To brush up, be sure to view the following:\n\n1. Khan Academy's [introduction to vectors](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors-and-spaces/vectors/v/vector-introduction-linear-algebra).\n2. Khan Academy's [introduction to matrices](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/precalc-matrices).\n\n##### Derivation\n\nBefore, we were dealing with only one output node which made the code straightforward. However now that we have multiple input units and multiple hidden units, the weights between them will require two indices: <span class='mathquill'> w_{ij} </span> where <span class='mathquill'>i</span> denotes input units and <span class='mathquill'>j</span> are the hidden units.\n\nFor example, the following image shows our network, with its input units labeled <span class='mathquill'>x_1, x_2,</span> and <span class='mathquill'>x_3</span>, and its hidden nodes labeled <span class='mathquill'>h_1</span> and <span class='mathquill'>h_2</span>:",

Instead, use `arr[:,None]` to create a column vector:\n\n```python\n\nprint(features)\n> array([ 0.49671415, -0.1382643 ,  0.64768854])\n\nprint(features.T)\n> array([ 0.49671415, -0.1382643 ,  0.64768854])\n\nprint(features[:, None])\n> array([[ 0.49671415],\n       [-0.1382643 ],\n       [ 0.64768854]])\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can create arrays with two dimensions.

The backpropagation algorithm is just an extension of that, using the chain rule to find the error with the respect to the weights connecting the input layer to the hidden layer (for a two layer network).\n\nTo update the weights to hidden layers using gradient descent, you need to know how much error each of the hidden units contributed to the final output. Since the output of a layer is determined by the weights between layers, the error resulting from units is scaled by the weights going forward through the network. Since we know the error at the output, we can use the weights to work backwards to hidden layers.\n\nFor example, in the output layer, you have errors <span class='mathquill'>\\delta^o_k</span> attributed to each output unit <span class='mathquill'>k</span>. Then, the error attributed to hidden unit <span class='mathquill'>j</span> is the output errors, scaled by the weights between the output and hidden layers (and the gradient):\n\n",

The maximum derivative of the sigmoid function is 0.25, so the errors in the output layer get reduced by at least 75%, and errors in the hidden layer are scaled down by at least 93.75%! You can see that if you have a lot of layers, using a sigmoid activation function will quickly reduce the weight steps to tiny values in layers near the input. This is known as the **vanishing gradient** problem. Later in the course you'll learn about other activation functions that perform better in this regard and are more commonly used in modern network architectures.",

              "text": "## Implementing in NumPy\n\nFor the most part you have everything you need to implement backpropagation with NumPy.\n\nHowever, previously we were only dealing with error terms from one unit. Now, in the weight update, we have to consider the error for *each unit* in the hidden layer, <span class='mathquill'>\\delta_j</span>:\n\n<span class='mathquill'> \\Delta w_{ij} = \\eta \\delta_j x_i </span>\n\nFirstly, there will likely be a different number of input and hidden units, so trying to multiply the errors and the inputs as row vectors will throw an error:\n\n```python\nhidden_error*inputs\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-22-3b59121cb809> in <module>()\n----> 1 hidden_error*x\n\nValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (3,) (6,) \n```\n\nAlso, <span class='mathquill'>w_{ij}</span> is a matrix now, so the right side of the assignment must have the same shape as the left side. Luckily, NumPy takes care of this for us. If you multiply a row vector array with a column vector array, it will multiply the first element in the column by each element in the row vector and set that as the first row in a new 2D array. This continues for each element in the column vector, so you get a 2D array that has shape `(len(column_vector), len(row_vector))`.\n\n```python\nhidden_error*inputs[:,None]\narray([[ -8.24195994e-04,  -2.71771975e-04,   1.29713395e-03],\n       [ -2.87777394e-04,  -9.48922722e-05,   4.52909055e-04],\n       [  6.44605731e-04,   2.12553536e-04,  -1.01449168e-03],\n       [  0.00000000e+00,   0.00000000e+00,  -0.00000000e+00],\n       [  0.00000000e+00,   0.00000000e+00,  -0.00000000e+00],\n       [  0.00000000e+00,   0.00000000e+00,  -0.00000000e+00]])\n```\n\nIt turns out this is exactly how we want to calculate the weight update step. As before, if you have your inputs as a 2D array with one row, you can also do `hidden_error*inputs.T`, but that won't work if `inputs` is a 1D array.",
