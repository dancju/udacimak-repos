We will walk you through all the details, so don't worry if you have never used it before!  If you would like to learn or refresh on command lines, we strongly recommend going through this free [Shell Workshop](http://www.udacity.com/course/shell-workshop--ud206) lesson, where you can set up and learn how to use Unix Shell commands.\n\n### ** Note to Windows Users: Install Git Bash\nAs noted in the free Shell Workshop linked above, we recommend you install Git Bash [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and use this as your terminal for this lesson. *Please note that during installation you should select the checkbox* **Use Git and Optional Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt**. This will allow you to use Unix commands while in Windows. If you'd rather use PowerShell, those commands are also provided in this lesson. For more information on the different command shells, check out the Shell Workshop lesson linked above.\n\n## 2. Is Python Already Installed On Your Computer?\nIn this course, we're using the most recent major version of Python - Python 3. Although Python 2 is still being used in many places, it is no longer being updated. In order to keep up compatibility with future improvements to Python, we recommend using Python 3.\n\nMac OS X and Linux usually come with Python 2 already installed. We DO NOT recommend that you make any changes to this Python, since parts of the operating system are using Python. However, it shouldn't do any harm to your system to install Python 3 separately, too.\n\nWindows doesn't usually come with Python included, but you can still check whether you have it installed before going ahead. So, first, check that you’ve not already got Python 3 installed.\n\nOpen up your Terminal or Command Line (this would be Git Bash on Windows).\n\nIn a new terminal or command prompt, type\n```bash\n$ python --version\n```\nand press `Enter`.\n\nYou might get a response that the Python version installed is something like `Python 2.7.9`. In that case, it would tell you that you have Python 2 installed, and you'll want to follow the steps in the next couple of sections to update it to Python 3.\n\nIf instead the version number starts with a 3, then you already have Python 3 installed! Don't install Python again! \n\nAlternatively, you might see an error message - don't worry about that for now, just try the steps in the next couple of sections.",

With Anaconda, it's simple to install the packages you'll often use in data science work. You'll also use it to create virtual environments that make working on multiple projects much less mind-twisting. Anaconda has simplified my workflow and solved a lot of issues I had dealing with packages and multiple Python versions. \n\nAnaconda is actually a distribution of software that comes with `conda`, Python, and over 150 scientific packages and their dependencies. The application `conda` is a package and environment manager. Anaconda is a fairly large download (~500 MB) because it comes with the most common data science packages in Python. If you don't need all the packages or need to conserve bandwidth or storage space,  there is also **Miniconda**, a smaller distribution that includes only `conda` and Python. Miniconda can do everything Anaconda does, but doesn't have the preinstalled packages. You can still install any of the available packages with `conda`, it just doesn't come with them, so either Anaconda or Miniconda are fine for this course.\n\n`Conda` is a program you'll be using exclusively from the command line, so if you aren't comfortable using it, check out this [command prompt tutorial for Windows](https://www.lynda.com/-tutorials/Windows-command-line-basics/497312/513424-4.html) or our [Linux Command Line Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/linux-command-line-basics--ud595) course for OSX/Linux.\n\nYou probably already have Python installed and wonder why you need this at all. First, since Anaconda comes with a bunch of data science packages, you'll be all set to start working with data. Secondly, using `conda` to manage your packages and environments will reduce future issues dealing with the various libraries you'll be using.\n\n## Managing Packages\n\n\n\n\n",

You’re probably already familiar with pip, it’s the default package manager for Python libraries. Conda is similar to pip except that the available packages are focused around data science while pip is for general use. However, conda is *not* Python specific like pip is, it can also install non-Python packages. It is a package manager for *any* software stack. That being said, not all Python libraries are available from the Anaconda distribution and conda. You can (and will) still use pip alongside conda to install packages.\n\nConda installs precompiled packages. For example, the Anaconda distribution comes with Numpy, Scipy and Scikit-learn compiled with the [MKL library](https://docs.continuum.io/mkl-optimizations/), speeding up various math operations. The packages are maintained by contributors to the distribution which means they usually lag behind new releases. But because someone needed to build the packages for many systems, they tend to be more stable (and more convenient for you).\n\n## Environments",

It's similar to [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) and [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv), other popular environment managers. \n\nEnvironments allow you to separate and isolate the packages you are using for different projects. Often you’ll be working with code that depends on different versions of some library. For example, you could have code that uses new features in Numpy, or code that uses old features that have been removed. It’s practically impossible to have two versions of Numpy installed at once. Instead, you should make an environment for each version of Numpy then work in the appropriate environment for the project.\n\nThis issue also happens a lot when dealing with Python 2 and Python 3. You might be working with old code that doesn’t run in Python 3 and new code that doesn’t run in Python 2. Having both installed can lead to a lot of confusion and bugs. It’s much better to have separate environments.\n\nYou can also export the list of packages in an environment to a file, then include that file with your code. This allows other people to easily load all the dependencies for your code. Pip has similar functionality with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.\n\n## Where we go from here\nNext, I'll get into the details of using Anaconda.

You can find the installers at [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and the installation instructions [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). \n\nIf you already have Python installed on your computer, this won't break anything. Instead, the default Python used by your scripts and programs will be the one that comes with Anaconda.\n\nChoose the Python 3.7 version, you can install Python 2 versions later. Also, choose the 64-bit installer if you have a 64-bit operating system, otherwise go with the 32-bit installer. Go ahead and choose the appropriate version, then install it. Continue on afterwards!\n\nAfter installation, you’re automatically in the default conda environment with all packages installed which you can see below. You can check out your own install by entering `conda list` into your terminal.\n\n<video loop autoplay>\n  <source src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/ud1111/conda_default_install.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n\n## On Windows\nA bunch of applications are installed along with Anaconda:\n\n* **Anaconda Navigator**, a GUI for managing your environments and packages\n* **Anaconda Prompt**, a terminal where you can use the command line interface to manage your environments and packages\n* **Spyder**, an IDE geared toward scientific development\n\nTo avoid errors later, it's best to update all the packages in the default environment. Open the **Anaconda Prompt** application. In the prompt, run the following commands:\n\n    conda upgrade conda\n    conda upgrade --all\n\nand answer yes when asked if you want to install the packages. The packages that come with the initial install tend to be out of date, so updating them now will prevent future errors from out of date software.\n\n**Note:** In the previous step, running `conda upgrade conda` should not be necessary because `--all` includes the conda package itself, but some users have encountered errors without it.\n\nIn the rest of this lesson, I'll be asking you to use commands in your terminal. I highly suggest you start working with Anaconda this way, then later use the GUI if you'd like. \n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you are seeing the following \"conda command not found\" and are using ZShell, you have to do the following:\n* Add `export PATH=\"/Users/username/anaconda/bin:$PATH\"` to your .zsh_config file.\n",

              "text": "# Managing Packages\n\nOnce you have Anaconda installed, managing packages is fairly straightforward. To install a package, type `conda install package_name` in your terminal. For example, to install numpy, type `conda install numpy`.\n\n<video controls loop autoplay>\n  <source src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/ud1111/conda_install.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n\nYou can install multiple packages at the same time. Something like `conda install numpy scipy pandas` will install all those packages simultaneously. It's also possible to specify which version of a package you want by adding the version number such as `conda install numpy=1.10`.\n\nConda also automatically installs dependencies for you. For example `scipy` depends on `numpy`, it uses and requires `numpy`. If you install just `scipy` (`conda install scipy`), Conda will also install `numpy` if it isn't already installed.\n\nMost of the commands are pretty intuitive. To uninstall, use `conda remove package_name`. To update a package `conda update package_name`. If you want to update all packages in an environment, which is often useful, use `conda update --all`. And finally, to list installed packages, it's `conda list` which you've seen before.\n\nIf you don't know the exact name of the package you're looking for, you can try searching with `conda search *search_term*`. For example, I know I want to install [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), but I'm not sure of the exact package name. So, I try `conda search *beautifulsoup*`. Note that your shell might expand the wildcard `*` before running the conda command. To fix this, wrap the search string in single or double quotes like `conda search '*beautifulsoup*'`.\n",

All new Python code should be written for version 3. Read more [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3).\n\n## The main breakage between Python 2 and 3\n\nFor the most part, Python 2 code will work with Python 3. Of course, most new features introduced with Python 3 versions won't be backwards compatible. The place where your Python 2 code will fail most often is the `print` statement.\n\nFor most of Python's history including Python 2, printing was done like so:\n\n    print \"Hello\", \"world!\"\n    > Hello world!\n\nThis was changed in Python 3 to a function.\n\n    print(\"Hello\", \"world!\")\n    > Hello world!\n\nThe `print` function was back-ported to Python 2 in version 2.6 through the `__future__` module:\n```python\n    # In Python 2.6+\n    from __future__ import print_function\n    print(\"Hello\", \"world!\")\n    > Hello world!\n```\nThe `print` statement doesn't work in Python 3. If you want to print something and have it work in both Python versions, you'll need to import `print_function` in your Python 2 code.",

The notebook is a web application that allows you to combine explanatory text, math equations, code, and visualizations all in one easily sharable document. For example, here's one of my favorite notebooks shared recently, the analysis of [gravitational waves from two colliding blackholes](https://losc.ligo.org/s/events/GW150914/GW150914_tutorial.html) detected by the [LIGO experiment](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20160211). You could download the data, run the code in the notebook, and repeat the analysis, in effect detecting the gravitational waves yourself!\n\nNotebooks have quickly become an essential tool when working with data. You'll find them being used for [data cleaning and exploration](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jmsteinw/Notebooks/blob/master/IndeedJobs.ipynb), visualization, [machine learning](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/masinoa/machine_learning/blob/master/04_Neural_Networks.ipynb), and [big data analysis](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tdhopper/rta-pyspark-presentation/blob/master/slides.ipynb). Here's [an example notebook](https://github.com/mcleonard/blog_posts/blob/master/body_fat_percentage.ipynb) I made for my personal blog that shows off many of the features of notebooks. Typically you'd be doing this work in a terminal, either the normal Python shell or with IPython. Your visualizations would be in separate windows, any documentation would be in separate documents, along with various scripts for functions and classes. However, with notebooks, all of these are in one place and easily read together.\n\nNotebooks are also rendered automatically on GitHub. It’s a great feature that lets you easily share your work. There is also http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ that renders the notebooks from your GitHub repo or from notebooks stored elsewhere.   ",

In Donald Knuth's words, \n\n> Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.\n\nAfter all, code is written for humans, not for computers. Notebooks provide exactly this capability. You are able to write documentation as narrative text, along with code. This is not only useful for the people reading your notebooks, but for your future self coming back to the analysis. \n\nJust a small aside: recently, this idea of literate programming has been extended to a whole programming language, [Eve](http://www.witheve.com/).",

You connect to the server through your browser and the notebook is rendered as a web app. Code you write in the web app is sent through the server to the kernel. The kernel runs the code and sends it back to the server, then any output is rendered back in the browser. When you save the notebook, it is written to the server as a JSON file with a `.ipynb` file extension.\n\nThe great part of this architecture is that the kernel doesn't need to run Python. Since the notebook and the kernel are separate, code in any language can be sent between them. For example, two of the earlier non-Python kernels were for the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Julia](http://julialang.org/) languages. With an R kernel, code written in R will be sent to the R kernel where it is executed, exactly the same as Python code running on a Python kernel. IPython notebooks were renamed because notebooks became language agnostic. The new name **Jupyter** comes from the combination of **Ju**lia, **Pyt**hon, and **R**. If you're interested, here's a [list of available kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels).\n\nAnother benefit is that the server can be run anywhere and accessed via the internet. Typically you'll be running the server on your own machine where all your data and notebook files are stored. But, you could also [set up a server](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public_server.html) on a remote machine or cloud instance like Amazon's EC2. Then, you can access the notebooks in your browser from anywhere in the world.  ",

By default, the notebook server runs at `http://localhost:8888`. If you aren't familiar with this, `localhost` means your computer and `8888` is the port the server is communicating on. As long as the server is still running, you can always come back to it by going to http://localhost:8888 in your browser.\n\nIf you start another server, it'll try to use port `8888`, but since it is occupied, the new server will run on port `8889`. Then, you'd connect to it at `http://localhost:8889`. Every additional notebook server will increment the port number like this.\n\nIf you tried starting your own server, it should look something like this:",

Including text allows you to write a narrative alongside your code, as well as documenting your code and the thoughts that went into it.\n\nYou can find the [documentation here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics), but I'll provide a short primer.\n\n## Headers\n\nYou can write headers using the pound/hash/[octothorpe](http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-oct1.htm) symbol `#` placed before the text. One `#` renders as an `h1` header, two `#`s is an h2, and so on. Looks like this:\n\n```[Markdown]\n# Header 1\n## Header 2\n### Header 3\n```\nrenders as \n\n# Header 1\n## Header 2\n### Header 3",

If you are using other kernels, these most likely won't work.\n\n## Timing code\n\nAt some point, you'll probably spend some effort optimizing code to run faster.

To render figures directly in the notebook, you should use the inline backend with the command `%matplotlib inline`.\n\n> **Tip:** On higher resolution screens such as Retina displays, the default images in notebooks can look blurry.
