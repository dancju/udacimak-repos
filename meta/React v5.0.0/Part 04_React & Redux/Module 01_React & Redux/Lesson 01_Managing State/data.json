However, it is not a topic for beginners and can be a daunting area to break into. We've broken down your path to learning Redux into the following lessons:\n\n* Lesson 1 - Managing State\n* Lesson 2 - UI + Redux\n* Lesson 3 - Redux Middleware\n* Lesson 4 - Redux with React\n* Lesson 5 - Asynchronous Redux\n* Lesson 6 - react-redux\n* Lesson 7 - Real World Redux\n\n### Lesson 1 - Managing State\n\nYou’ll learn techniques to make your state more predictable by moving your state to a central location and establishing strict rules for getting, listening, and updating that state.\n\n### Lesson 2 - UI + Redux\n\nYou’ll learn to move away from having state live in the DOM by creating a vanilla JavaScript application whose state is managed entirely by Redux.\n\n### Lesson 3 - Redux Middleware\n\nYou’ll learn to create custom middleware and add it to your Redux store. This middleware will allow you to enhance your store by hooking into and intercepting actions before they reach any reducers.\n\n### Lesson 4 - Redux with React\n\nYou’ll learn how to add React to a Redux application and have the state of that application be managed by Redux.\n\n### Lesson 5 - Asynchronous Redux\n\nYou’ll learn to better abstract asynchronous events by creating your own custom Thunk middleware and adding it to your store.\n\n### Lesson 6 - react-redux\n\nYou’ll learn to leverage the react-redux bindings in order to leverage the benefits of a UI library like React and a state management library like Redux.\n\n### Lesson 7 - Real World Redux\n\nYou’ll take your knowledge of Redux and utilize it by building a real world Redux application. You’ll also learn advanced Redux topics like reducer composition and normalization.",

So all of the state (or \"application data\") for this site is stored in one, single location. This is what we mean when we say \"state tree\"...it's just all of the data stored in a single object.\n\nThroughout this course, whenever we refer to an application's \"state tree\", we'll use a triangle to convey this concept.",

This can lead to hard-to-find bugs where updating the state in one location doesn't update it in every location. \n\nWe learned that the main goal that Redux is trying to offer is predictable state management. The way that Redux tries to accomplish this is through having a _single_ *state tree*. This state tree is an object that stores the entire state for an application. Now that all state is stored in one location, we discovered three ways to interact with it:\n\n1. getting the state\n* listening for changes to the state\n* updating the state\n\nThen we combine the three items above and the state tree object itself into one unit which we called *the store*. We'll look at creating this store in the next lesson.",

              "text": "When an event takes place in a Redux application, we use a plain JavaScript object to keep track of what the specific event was. This object is called an **Action**. \n\nLet's take another look at an Action:\n\n```js\n{\n  type: \"ADD_PRODUCT_TO_CART\"\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, an Action is clearly just a **plain JavaScript object**. What makes this plain JavaScript object special in Redux, is that _every Action must have a `type` property_. The purpose of the `type` property is to let our app (Redux) know _exactly_ what event just took place. This Action tells us that a product was added to the cart. That's incredibly descriptive and quite helpful, isn't it?\n\nNow, since an Action is just a regular object, we can include extra data about the event that took place:\n\n```js\n{\n  type: \"ADD_PRODUCT_TO_CART\",\n  productId: 17\n}\n```\n\nIn this Action, we're including the `productId` field. Now we know exactly which product was added to the store! \n\nOne more note to keep in mind as you build your Action objects: it's better practice to pass as little data as possible in each action. That is, prefer passing the index or ID of a product rather than the _entire product object_ itself.\n\n**Action Creators** are functions that create/return action objects. For example: \n\n```js\nconst addItem = item => ({\n  type: ADD_ITEM,\n  item\n});\n```\nor in ES5:\n\n```js\nvar addItem = function addItem(item) {\n  return {\n    type: ADD_ITEM,\n    item: item\n  };\n};\n```\n",

Return the same result if the same arguments are passed in\n* Depend solely on the arguments passed into them\n* Do not produce side effects, such as API requests and I/O operations\n\nLet’s check out an example of a pure function, `square()`:\n\n```js\n// `square()` is a pure function\n\nconst square = x => x * x;\n```\n\n`square()` is a pure function because it outputs the same value every single time, given that the same argument is passed into it. There is no dependence on any other values to produce that result, and we can safely expect _just_ that result to be returned -- no side effects (more on this in a bit!).\n\nOn the other hand, let’s check out an example of an _impure_ function, `calculateTip()`:\n\n```js\n// `calculateTip()` is an impure function\n\nconst tipPercentage = 0.15;\n\nconst calculateTip = cost => cost * tipPercentage;\n```\n\n`calculateTip()` calculates and returns a number value. However, it relies on a variable (`tipPercentage`) that lives _outside_ the function to produce that value. Since it fails one of the requirements of pure functions, `calculateTip()` is an impure function. However, we could convert this function to a pure function by passing in the outside variable, `tipPercentage`, as a second argument to this function!\n\n```js\nconst calculateTip = (cost, tipPercentage = 0.15) => cost * tipPercentage;\n```\n\n### Why Pure Functions Are Great\n\nFor our purposes, the most important feature of a pure function is that it's predictable. If we have a function that takes in our state and an action that occurred, the function should (if it's pure!) return the exact same result _every single time_. \n\nYou're going to be sick of this by the end ;-) but this course (and Redux!) are all about predictability!",

              "text": "## Recap of New Actions\n\nOur app can not only handle _adding_ todo items -- it can now handle _removing_ a todo item, as well as _toggling_ a todo item (as complete or incomplete)! To make this all possible, we updated our `todos` reducer to be able to respond to actions of the `type` `REMOVE_TODO` and `TOGGLE_TODO`. \n\nBefore moving on, let's make sure we're on the same page on how this was all implemented. Our `todos` reducer originally looked like the following:\n\n```js\nfunction todos (state = [], action) {\n  if (action.type === 'ADD_TODO') {\n    return state.concat([action.todo]);\n  }\n\n  return state;\n}\n```\n\nTo resolve additional action types, we added a few more conditions to our reducer logic:\n\n```js\nfunction todos (state = [], action) {\n  if (action.type === 'ADD_TODO') {\n    return state.concat([action.todo]);\n  } else if (action.type === 'REMOVE_TODO') {\n    // ...\n  } else if (action.type === 'TOGGLE_TODO') {\n    // ...\n  } else {\n    return state;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote that just like the original `todos` reducer, we simply return the original state if the reducer receives an action type that it's not concerned with.\n\nTo remove a todo item, we called `filter()` on the state. This returns a new state (an array) with only todo items whose `id`'s _do not_ match the `id` of the todo we want to remove:\n\n```js\nfunction todos (state = [], action) {\n  if (action.type === 'ADD_TODO') {\n    return state.concat([action.todo]);\n  } else if (action.type === 'REMOVE_TODO') {\n    return state.filter((todo) => todo.id !== action.id);\n  } else if (action.type === 'TOGGLE_TODO') {\n    // ...\n  } else {\n    return state;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo handle toggling a todo item, we want to change the value of the `complete` property on whatever `id` is passed along on the action. We mapped over the entire state, and if `todo.id` matched `action.id`, we used `Object.assign()` to return a new object with merged properties:\n\n```js\nfunction todos (state = [], action) {\n  if (action.type === 'ADD_TODO') {\n    return state.concat([action.todo]);\n  } else if (action.type === 'REMOVE_TODO') {\n    return state.filter((todo) => todo.id !== action.id);\n  } else if (action.type === 'TOGGLE_TODO') {\n    return state.map((todo) => todo.id !== action.id ? todo :\n    Object.assign({}, todo, { complete: !todo.complete }));\n  } else {\n    return state;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe then refactored our entire `todos` reducer to use a `switch` statement rather than multiple `if`/`else` statements:\n\n```js\nfunction todos (state = [], action) {\n  switch(action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TODO' :\n      return state.concat([action.todo]);\n    case 'REMOVE_TODO' :\n      return state.filter((todo) => todo.id !== action.id);\n    case 'TOGGLE_TODO' :\n      return state.map((todo) => todo.id !== action.id ? todo :\n      Object.assign({}, todo, { complete: !todo.complete }));\n    default :\n      return state;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn the above snippet, we matched `cases` against an expression (i.e., `action.type`), and executed statements associated with that particular `case`. \n\nLet's now extend our app with some additional functionality!",
