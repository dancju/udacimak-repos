For an interest rate statement to be clear, the magnitude and time dependence of the rate of interest, as well as the frequency of compounding, must be clearly stated.\n\nIf the interest rate is measured with annual compounding, the bank’s statement that the interest rate is 4% means that $100 grows to <span class=\"mathquill\">\\$100\\times(1 + .04) = \\$104 </span> at the end of 1 year. \n\nWhen the interest rate is measured with semiannual compounding, it means that 2% is earned every 6 months, with the interest being reinvested.

If you assumed that the benefit of compounding more and more frequently had a limit, you would be right! How do we calculate this limit? Well, first we write down the formula for compounding,\n\n<span class=\"mathquill\">p_t = p_{t-1}(1 + \\frac{r}{n})^n</span>,\n\nand then we notice that what we'd like to do is make n bigger and bigger.

So what does this mean? Well, it means that if you wanted to calculate how much money you’d have at the end of the year if you started with $100 and compounded _continuously_, but at a simple annual rate of 4%, you’d calculate:\n\n<span class=\"mathquill\">\\$100 \\times \\mathrm{e}^{.04} = \\$104.08</span>\n\nYou'll notice that the value after 1 year with _continuous_ compounding is pretty close (it's the same if we round to two decimal places) to the value after 1 year with _daily_ compounding.",

An important first step is to think of these prices and returns as _random variables_, i.e. outcomes of random phenomena, that take on values as described by _distributions_. Distributions allow us to summarize the behavior of random variables. So, what are the distributions of returns and prices?\n\nOne strategy for getting a sense of potential future behavior is to look to the past.

On the other hand, **log returns** _sum_ over time. Therefore, if <span class=\"mathquill\">R_1 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_0}\\right)</span> and <span class=\"mathquill\">R_2 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_2}{p_1}\\right)</span> are normal, their sum, the two-period log return, is also normal. Even if they are not normal, as long as they are IID, their long-term sum will be approximately normal, thanks to the Central Limit Theorem. This is one reason why using log returns can be convenient for modeling purposes.",

              "text": "Let's summarize what we just learned. These are some generally accepted reasons that quantitative analysts use log returns:\n\n1. Log returns can be interpreted as continuously compounded returns. \n2. Log returns are time-additive. The multi-period log return is simply the sum of single period log returns. \n3. The use of log returns prevents security prices from becoming negative in models of security\nreturns.\n4. For many purposes, log returns of a security can be reasonably modeled as distributed according to a normal distribution.\n5. When returns and log returns are small (their absolute values are much less than 1), their values are approximately equal.\n6. Logarithms can help make an algorithm more numerically stable.\n\nStepping back, it may not be immediately obvious why all these attributes are benefits. Don't worry about this. As you progress in this course and beyond, you will see more applications of returns and log returns in trading strategies and algorithms and you'll be able to better appreciate why they are used.",
