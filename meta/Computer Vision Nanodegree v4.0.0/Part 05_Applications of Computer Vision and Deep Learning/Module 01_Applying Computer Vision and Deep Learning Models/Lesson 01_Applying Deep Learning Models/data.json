Style transfer allows you to take famous paintings, and recreate your own images in their styles! The network learns the underlying techniques of those paintings and figures out how to apply them on its own. This model was trained on the styles of famous paintings and is able to transfer those styles to other images and [even videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVJwwWQlQ1o)!\n\nMat Leonard, the product lead for the school of AI, used it to style his cat Chihiro in the style of [Hokusai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokusai)'s  [*The Great Wave Off Kanagawa*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa).",

Either use `git` to clone the repository, or you can download the whole thing as a Zip archive and extract it.\n\nThe network has been trained on a few different styles ([here](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer/tree/master/examples/style)) and saved into [checkpoint files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9jhaT37ydSyRk9UX0wwX3BpMzQ). Checkpoint files contain all the information about the trained network to apply styles to new images.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe easiest way to install all the packages needed to run this code is with [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html), a smaller version of [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Miniconda comes with Conda, a package and environment manager built specifically for data science. Install the Python 3 version of Miniconda appropriate for your operating system.\n\nIf you haven't used Conda before, please quickly run through the Anaconda lesson (Lesson 3 on this part).\n\n### Windows\n\nFor Windows, you'll need to install TensorFlow 0.12.1, Python 3.5, Pillow 3.4.2, scipy 0.18.1, and numpy 1.11.2.  After installing Miniconda, open your command prompt. In there, enter these commands line by line:\n\n```bash\nconda create -n style-transfer python=3\nactivate style-transfer\nconda install tensorflow scipy pillow\npip install moviepy\npython -c \"import imageio; imageio.plugins.ffmpeg.download()\"\n```\n\n### OS X and Linux \n\nFor OS X and Linux, you'll need to install TensorFlow 0.11.0, Python 2.7.9, Pillow 3.4.2, scipy 0.18.1, and numpy 1.11.2.  \n\nIn your terminal, enter this commands line by line:\n\n```bash\nconda create -n style-transfer python=3\nactivate style-transfer\nconda install tensorflow scipy pillow\npip install moviepy\npython -c \"import imageio; imageio.plugins.ffmpeg.download()\"\n```\n\nLet’s take a quick look at what these commands do. The first line in both sets of instructions, creates a new environment with Python 3. This environment will hold all the packages you need for the style transfer code. The next line enters the environment.  Next, we install TensorFlow, SciPy, Pillow (which is an image processing library), and moviepy. The last line here installs ffmpeg, an application for converting images and videos.\n",

Download the Rain Princess checkpoint from [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/January/587d1865_rain-princess/rain-princess.ckpt). Put it in the fast-style-transfer folder.

Copy the image you want to style into the fast-style-transfer folder.\n4. Enter the Conda environment you created above, if you aren't still in it.\n\nFinally, in your terminal, navigate to the fast-style-transfer folder and enter\n```bash\npython evaluate.py --checkpoint ./rain-princess.ckpt --in-path <path_to_input_file> --out-path ./output_image.jpg\n```\n\n> **Note:** Your checkpoint file might be named `rain_princess.ckpt`, notice the underscore, it's not the dash from above.\n\nYou can get more checkpoint files at the bottom of this page.

As such, we recommend checking out a few of the books below to get an added perspective on Deep Learning.\n\n* [Grokking Deep Learning](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning) by Andrew Trask. Use our exclusive discount code **traskud17** for 40% off. This provides a very gentle introduction to Deep Learning and covers the intuition more than the theory.\n\n\n* [Neural Networks And Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael Nielsen. This book is more rigorous than Grokking Deep Learning and includes a lot of fun, interactive visualizations to play with.\n\n\n* [The Deep Learning Textbook](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) from Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. This online book contains a lot of material and is the most rigorous of the three books suggested.",
