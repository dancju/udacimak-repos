              "text": "As mentioned earlier, the heap memory grows upwards while the stack grows in the opposite direction.  We have seen in the last lesson that the automatic stack memory shrinks and grows with each function call and local variable. As soon as the scope of a variable is left, it is automatically deallocated and the stack pointer is shifted upwards accordingly. \n\nHeap memory is different in many ways: The programmer can request the allocation of memory by issuing a command such as `malloc` or `new` (more on that shortly). This block of memory will remain allocated until the programmer explicitly issues a command such as `free` or `delete`. The huge advantage of heap memory is the high degree of control a programmer can exert, albeit at the price of greater responsibility since memory on the heap must be actively managed. \n\nLet us take a look at some properties of heap memory:\n\n1. As opposed to local variables on the stack, memory can now be allocated in an arbitrary scope (e.g. inside a function) without it being deleted when the scope is left. Thus, as long as the address to an allocated block of memory is returned by a function, the caller can freely use it. \n\n2. Local variables on the stack are allocated at compile-time. Thus, the size of e.g. a string variable might not be appropriate as the length of the string will not be known until the program is executed and the user inputs it. With local variables, a solution would be to allocate a long-enough array of and hope that the actual length does not exceed the buffer size. With dynamically allocated heap memory, variables are allocated at run-time. This means that the size of the above-mentioned string variable can be tailored to the actual length of the user input. \n\n3. Heap memory is only constrained by the size of the address space and by the available memory. With modern 64 bit operating systems and large RAM memory and hard disks the programmer commands a vast amount of memory. However, if the programmer forgets to deallocate a block of heap memory, it will remain unused until the program is terminated. This is called a \"memory leak\".\n\n4. Unlike the stack, the heap is shared among multiple threads, which means that memory management for the heap needs to take concurrency into account as several threads might compete for the same memory resource. \n\n5. When memory is allocated or deallocated on the stack, the stack pointer is simply shifted upwards or downwards. Due to the sequential structure of stack memory management, stack memory can be managed (by the operating system) easily and securely. With heap memory, allocation and deallocation can occur arbitrarily, depending on the lifetime of the variables. This can result in fragmented memory over time, which is much more difficult and expensive to manage. \n\n## Memory Fragmentation\nLet us construct a theoretic example of how memory on the heap can become fragmented: Suppose we are interleaving the allocation of two data types `X` and `Y` in the following fashion: First, we allocate a block of memory for a variable of type `X`, then another block for `Y` and so on in a repeated manner until some upper bound is reached. At the end of this operation, the heap might look like the following: ",

On systems with virtual memory however, this is less of a problem, because large allocations only need to be contiguous in virtual address space, not in physical address space. \n\nWhen memory is heavily fragmented however, memory allocations will likely take longer because the memory allocator has to do more work to find a suitable space for the new object.\n\nUntil now, our examples have been only theoretical. It is time to gain some practical experience in the next section using `malloc` and `free` as C-style methods for dynamic memory management.",

The overloaded new operator function allows to **add additional parameters**. Therefore, a class can have multiple overloaded new operator functions. This gives the programmer more flexibility in customizing the memory allocation for objects. \n\n2. Overloaded the new and delete operators provides an easy way to **integrate a mechanism similar to garbage collection** capabilities (such as in Java), as we will shorty see later in this course. \n\n3. By adding **exception handling capabilities** into new and delete, the code can be made more robust. \n\n4. It is very easy to add customized behavior, such as overwriting deallocated memory with zeros in order to increase the security of critical application data. ",

              "text": "## Overview of memory management problems\nOne of the primary advantages of C++ is the flexibility and control of resources such as memory it gives to the programmer. This advantage is further amplified by a significant increase in the performance of C++ programs compared to other languages such as Python or Java.\n\nHowever, these advantages come at a price as they demand a high level of experience from the programer. As Bjarne Stroustrup put it so elegantly: \n\n*\"C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole leg off\".* \n\nIn this chapter, we will look at a collection of typical errors in memory management that you need to watch out for. \n\n1. **Memory Leaks**\nMemory leaks occur when data is allocated on the heap at runtime, but not properly deallocated. A program that forgets to clear a memory block is said to have a memory leak - this may be a serious problem or not, depending on the circumstances and on the nature of the program. \nFor a program that runs, computes something, and quits immediately, memory leaks are usually not a big concern. Memory leaks are mostly problematic for programs that run for a long time and/or use large data structures. In such a case, memory leaks can gradually fill the heap until allocation requests can no longer be properly met and the program stops responding or crashes completely. We will look at an example further down in this section. \n\n2. **Buffer Overruns**\nBuffer overruns occur when memory outside the allocated limits is overwritten and thus corrupted. One of the resulting problems is that this effect may not become immediately visible. When a problem finally does occur, cause and effect are often hard to discern. It is also sometimes possible to inject malicious code into programs in this way, but this shall not be discussed here.  \n\n  In this example, the allocated stack memory is too small to hold the entire string, which results in a segmentation fault: \n```cpp\nchar str[5];\nstrcpy(str,\"BufferOverrun\");\nprintf(\"%s\",str);\n```\n\n\n3. **Uninitialized Memory**\nDepending on the C++ compiler, data structures are sometimes initialized (most often to zero) and sometimes not. So when allocating memory on the heap without proper initialization, it might sometimes contain garbage that can cause problems. \n\n  Generally, a variable will be automatically initialized in these cases: \n  * it is a class instance where the default constructor initializes all primitive types\n  * array initializer syntax is used, such as int a[10] = {}\n  * it is a global or extern variable\n  * it is defined `static`\n\n  The behavior of the following code is potentially undefined:\n```cpp\nint a;\nint b=a*42;\nprintf(\"%d\",b);\n```\n\n4. **Incorrect pairing of allocation and deallocation**\nFreeing a block of memory more than once will cause a program to crash. This can happen when a block of memory is freed that has never been allocated or has been freed before. Such behavior could also occur when improper pairings of allocation and deallocation are used such as using `malloc()` with `delete` or `new` with `free()`.\n\n  In this first example, the wrong `new` and `delete` are paired\n```cpp\ndouble *pDbl=new double[5];\ndelete pDbl;\n```\n\n  In this second example, the pairing is correct but a double deletion is performed:\n```cpp\nchar *pChr=new char[5];\ndelete[] pChr;\ndelete[] pChr;\n```\n\n5. **Invalid memory access**\nThis error occurs then trying to access a block of heap memory that has not yet or has already been deallocated. \n\n  In this example, the heap memory has already been deallocated at the time when `strcpy()` tries to access it: \n```\nchar *pStr=new char[25];\ndelete[] pStr;\nstrcpy(pStr, \"Invalid Access\");\n```\n\n\n## Debugging memory leaks with Valgrind",

Instead of spending a lot of time searching, it makes sense for C and C++ programmers to use helper tools to perform automatic analyses of their code.\n\nIn this section, we will look at *Valgrind*, a free software for Linux and Mac that is able to automatically detect memory. Windows programers can for example use the Visual Studio debugger and C Run-time Library (CRT) to detect and identify memory leaks. More information on how to do this can be found here: [Find memory leaks with the CRT Library - Visual Studio | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/finding-memory-leaks-using-the-crt-library?view=vs-2019)\n\nWith recent versions of MacOS, occasional difficulties have been reported with installing Valgrind. A working version for MacOS Mojave can be downloaded from GitHub via Homebrew: [GitHub - sowson/valgrind: Experimental Version of Valgrind for macOS 10.14.6 Mojave](https://github.com/sowson/valgrind)\n\nValgrind is a framework that facilitates the development of tools for the dynamic analysis of programs. Dynamic analysis examines the behavior of a program at runtime, in contrast to static analysis, which often checks programs for various criteria or potential errors at the source code level before, during, or after translation. More information on Valgrind can be found here: [Valgrind: About](http://valgrind.org/info/)\n\nThe Memcheck tool within Valgrind can be used to detect typical errors in programs written in C or C++ that occur in connection with memory management. It is probably the best-known tool in the Valgrind suite, and the name Valgrind is often used as a synonym for Memcheck.\n\nThe following code generates a memory leak as the integer array has been allocated on the heap but the deallocation has been forgotten by the programmer: ",
