              "text": "## How `componentDidMount()` Works\n \nIf you remember from the previous section, `componentDidMount()` is the lifecycle hook that is run right after the component is added to the DOM and should be used if you're fetching remote data or doing an Ajax request. Here's what the React docs have to say about it:\n \n> `componentDidMount()` is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. Initialization that requires DOM nodes should go here. If you need to load data from a remote endpoint, this is a good place to instantiate the network request. Setting state in this method will trigger a re-rendering.\n \nLet's take a look at an example User component:\n \n```js\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport fetchUser from '../utils/UserAPI';\n\nclass User extends Component {\n constructor(props) {\n   super(props);\n\n   this.state = {\n     name: '',\n     age: ''\n   };\n }\n\n componentDidMount() {\n   fetchUser().then((user) => this.setState({\n     name: user.name,\n     age: user.age\n   }));\n }\n\n render() {\n   return (\n     <div>\n       <p>Name: {this.state.name}</p>\n       <p>Age: {this.state.age}</p>\n     </div>\n   );\n   }\n}\n\nexport default User;\n\n```\n \nYou'll notice that this component has a `componentDidMount()` lifecycle event. This component seems pretty straightforward, but let's walk through the order of how it works:\n \n1. The `render()` method is called which updates the page with a `<div>` that has one paragraph for the name and one paragraph for the age. What's important to realize is that `this.state.name` and `this.state.age` are empty strings (at first), so the name and age _don't actually display_\n* Once the component has been mounted, the `componentDidMount()` lifecycle event occurs\n - The `fetchUser` request from the `UserAPI` is run which sends a request to the user database\n - When the data is returned, `setState()` is called and updates the `name` and `age` properties\n* Since the state has changed, `render()` gets called again. This re-renders the page, but now `this.state.name` and `this.state.age` have values\n \nLet's use `componentDidMount()` to fetch real users from a server in our Contacts app!",

Now, there are a number of different lifecycle events. They will run at different points, but we can break them down into three distinct categories:\n \n### Adding to the DOM\nThe following lifecycle events will be called in order when a component is being added to the DOM:\n\n1. `constructor()`\n* `getDerivedStateFromProps()`\n* `render()`\n* `componentDidMount()`\n \n>⚠️componentWillMount() has been deprecated. ⚠️\n>\n>As of React 16.3, `componentWillMount()` has been replaced with `UNSAFE_componentWillMount()`. Only `UNSAFE_componentWillMount()` will work starting with React 17.0. `UNSAFE_componentWillMount()` is now considered to be a legacy method and should not be used in new code.\n\n\n### Re-rendering\nThe following lifecycle events will be called in order when a component is re-rendered to the DOM:\n\n1. `getDerivedStateFromProps()`\n* `shouldComponentUpdate()`\n* `render()`\n* `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`[(specific use cases)](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#getsnapshotbeforeupdate)\n* `componentDidUpdate()`\n\n> ⚠️`componentWillReceiveProps()` and `componentWillUpdate()` have been deprecated. ⚠️\n>\n> As of React 16.3, they have been replaced with `UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate()` and `UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps()`.
