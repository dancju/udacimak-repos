For example, say there are two possible outcomes, X1 and X2:\n\n* If `P(X1) = 0.2` then `P(X2) = 0.8` because all possible outcomes must sum to 1.\n\n",

When flipping a coin multiple times, each flip is an independent event because one flip does not affect the probability that another flip will land heads up or tails up.\n\n#### Dependent Events\n\nWhen two events are said to be *dependent*, the probability of one event occurring influences the likelihood of the other event. For example, say you are more likely to go outside if it's sunny weather. If the probability of sunny weather is low on a given day, the probability of you going outside will decrease as well, so the probability of going outside is dependent on the probability of sunny weather.",

This format is a little different to how you've seen quizzes presented so far. For quiz videos, a quiz will be located *right underneath* that video, to test your intuition of a concept, so **make sure to scroll down** to take a quiz. In some cases, you may find the solution to a given quiz in code or in a later video.\n\nFor notebook exercises, a solution notebook will be provided in case you get stuck or in case you want to check that your answer is correct! You are encouraged to skip quizzes that seem too easy and always try to implement a code solution before looking at solution code.",

When  a robot senses, a **measurement update** happens; this is a simple multiplication that is based off of Bayes' rule, which says that we can update our belief based on measurements! This step was also followed by a **normalization** that made sure the resultant distribution was still vald (and added up to 1).\n2. When it moves, a **motion update** or prediction step occurs; this step is a convolution that shifts the distribution in the direction of motion.\n\nAfter this cycle, we are left with an altered **posterior** distribution!",

This is because C++ is the language of hardware; most machines like robots, mobile phones, NVIDIA hardware, or autonomous vehicles, run on C++. \n\nC++ is closer to machine code and can run much faster on hardware than Python can and this is critical for time-sensitive applications. So, should you want to learn more about C++ programming, check out the Elective section to learn the basics of C++ and implement a histogram filter!\n\n**This elective course is a very good starting point for learning C++, especially if you are more comfortable with Python and want to expand your knowledge of programming languages. So, if you have any extra time, I highly recommend it!**\n\nBelow is a video describing what is taught in this elective section!\n",
