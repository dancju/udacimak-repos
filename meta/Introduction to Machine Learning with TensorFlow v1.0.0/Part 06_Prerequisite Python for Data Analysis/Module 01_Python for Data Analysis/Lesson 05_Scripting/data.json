We will walk you through all the details, so don't worry if you have never used it before!  If you would like to learn or refresh on command lines, we strongly recommend going through this free [Shell Workshop](http://www.udacity.com/course/shell-workshop--ud206) lesson, where you can set up and learn how to use Unix Shell commands.\n\n### ** Note to Windows Users: Install Git Bash\nAs noted in the free Shell Workshop linked above, we recommend you install Git Bash [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and use this as your terminal for this lesson. *Please note that during installation you should select the checkbox* **Use Git and Optional Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt**. This will allow you to use Unix commands while in Windows. If you'd rather use PowerShell, those commands are also provided in this lesson. For more information on the different command shells, check out the Shell Workshop lesson linked above.\n\n## 2. Is Python Already Installed On Your Computer?\nIn this course, we're using the most recent major version of Python - Python 3. Although Python 2 is still being used in many places, it is no longer being updated. In order to keep up compatibility with future improvements to Python, we recommend using Python 3.\n\nMac OS X and Linux usually come with Python 2 already installed. We DO NOT recommend that you make any changes to this Python, since parts of the operating system are using Python. However, it shouldn't do any harm to your system to install Python 3 separately, too.\n\nWindows doesn't usually come with Python included, but you can still check whether you have it installed before going ahead. So, first, check that you’ve not already got Python 3 installed.\n\nOpen up your Terminal or Command Line (this would be Git Bash on Windows).\n\nIn a new terminal or command prompt, type\n```bash\n$ python --version\n```\nand press `Enter`.\n\nYou might get a response that the Python version installed is something like `Python 2.7.9`. In that case, it would tell you that you have Python 2 installed, and you'll want to follow the steps in the next couple of sections to update it to Python 3.\n\nIf instead the version number starts with a 3, then you already have Python 3 installed! Don't install Python again! \n\nAlternatively, you might see an error message - don't worry about that for now, just try the steps in the next couple of sections.",

You should **install Python 3.6** for courses at Udacity.  Having a dual environment with two different versions of Python can be useful, but content across all of our courses, and most professional environments, has now been converted to the newest version of Python.\n\n Anaconda includes a great distribution of libraries and software built for data science, some of which are otherwise difficult to install. It also makes it really easy to [set up different environments](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) on your computer so you can quickly switch between different versions of Python and packages! For example, if one project you're working on requires Python 2.7 and another requires Python 3.6, as well as different dependencies, then Anaconda's environment management can help. \n\nIf you would like to know more about the Anaconda environment, you can check out the free course [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud1111) .",

The `input` function takes in whatever the user types and stores it as a string. If you want to interpret their input as something other than a string, like an integer, as in the example below, you need to wrap the result with the new type to convert it from a string.\n```python\nnum = int(input(\"Enter an integer\"))\nprint(\"hello\" * num)\n```\nWe can also interpret user input as a Python expression using the built-in function `eval`. This function evaluates a string as a line of Python. \n```python\nresult = eval(input(\"Enter an expression: \"))\nprint(result)\n```\nIf the user inputs `2 * 3`, this outputs `6`.",

You have each of their names, number of missing assignments, and grades on a spreadsheet and just have to insert them into placeholders in this message you came up with:\n\n>Hi __[insert student name]__,\n\n>This is a reminder that you have __[insert number of missing assignments]__ assignments left to submit before you can graduate. Your current grade is __[insert current grade]__ and can increase to __[insert potential grade]__ if you submit all assignments before the due date.\n\nYou can just copy and paste this message to each student and manually insert the appropriate values each time, but instead you're going to write a program that does this for you.\n\nWrite a script that does the following:\n1. Ask for user input 3 times. Once for a list of names, once for a list of missing assignment counts, and once for a list of grades. Use this input to create lists for `names`, `assignments`, and `grades`.\n2. Use a loop to print the message for each student with the correct values. The potential grade is simply the current grade added to two times the number of missing assignments.\n\n### Template code for your script:\n```python\nnames =  # get and process input for a list of names\nassignments =  # get and process input for a list of the number of assignments\ngrades =  # get and process input for a list of grades\n\n# message string to be used for each student\n# HINT: use .format() with this string in your for loop\nmessage = \"Hi {},\\n\\nThis is a reminder that you have {} assignments left to \\\nsubmit before you can graduate. You're current grade is {} and can increase \\\nto {} if you submit all assignments before the due date.\\n\\n\"\n\n# write a for loop that iterates through each set of names, assignments, and grades to print each student's message\n\n```\n\nBelow is an example of a successful run of this script in the terminal.",

There are four clauses you can use (one more in addition to those shown in the video).\n- `try`: This is the only mandatory clause in a `try` statement. The code in this block is the first thing that Python runs in a `try` statement.\n- `except`: If Python runs into an exception while running the `try` block, it will jump to the `except` block that handles that exception.\n- `else`: If Python runs into no exceptions while running the `try` block, it will run the code in this block after running the `try` block.\n- `finally`: Before Python leaves this `try` statement, it will run the code in this `finally` block under any conditions, even if it's ending the program. E.g., if Python ran into an error while running code in the `except` or `else` block, this `finally` block will still be executed before stopping the program.\n\n[Why do we need the `finally` clause in Python?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11551996/why-do-we-need-the-finally-clause-in-python)",

Edit the `party_planner` function to handle this invalid input. If it runs into this exception, it should print a warning message to the user and request they input a different number of people.\n\nAfter you've edited the function, try running the file again and make sure it does what you intended. Try it with several different input values, including 0 and other values for the number of people.\n\n### Using this workspace\nIn some pages of our classroom, we'll provide you a workspace like the one below that will provide you a programming environment with a Terminal and code editor, so you can do all your work right here. Here are a few tips orienting you to this kind of workspace.\n\nOn the top panel is a code editor where you can edit your Python file. Scroll up and down in this panel to see all the code. You can also expand or shrink this panel by clicking and dragging its bottom border.\n\nOn the bottom panel, you can execute this Python file by clicking on __New Terminal__  and entering `python handling_errors.py` on the command line.",

First open the file using the built-in function, `open`. This requires a string that shows the path to the file. The `open` function returns a file object, which is a Python object through which Python interacts with the file itself. Here, we assign this object to the variable `f`.\n2. There are optional parameters you can specify in the `open` function. One is the mode in which we open the file. Here, we use `r` or read only. This is actually the default value for the mode argument.\n3. Use the `read` method to access the contents from the file object. This `read` method takes the text contained in a file and puts it into a string. Here, we assign the string returned from this method into the variable `file_data`.\n4. When finished with the file, use the `close` method to free up any system resources taken up by the file.\n\n### Writing to a File\n```python\nf = open('my_path/my_file.txt', 'w')\nf.write(\"Hello there!\")\nf.close()\n```\n1. Open the file in writing ('w') mode. If the file does not exist, Python will create it for you. If you open an existing file in writing mode, any content that it had contained previously will be deleted. If you're interested in adding to an existing file, without deleting its content, you should use the append ('a') mode instead of write.\n2. Use the write method to add text to the file.\n3. Close the file when finished.\n\n### Too Many Open Files\nRun the following script in Python to see what happens when you open too many files without closing them!\n```python\nfiles = []\nfor i in range(10000):\n    files.append(open('some_file.txt', 'r'))\n    print(i)\n```",

This defaults to reading all the remainder of the file from its current position - the whole file. If you pass the `read` method an integer argument, it will read up to that number of characters, output all of them, and keep the 'window' at that position ready to read on. \n\nLet's see this in an example that uses the following file, `camelot.txt`:\n```txt\nWe're the knights of the round table\nWe dance whenever we're able\n```\nHere's a script that reads in the file a little at a time by passing an integer argument to `.read()`.\n```python\nwith open(\"camelot.txt\") as song:\n    print(song.read(2))\n    print(song.read(8))\n    print(song.read())\n```\nOutputs:\n```txt\nWe\n're the \nknights of the round table\nWe dance whenever we're able\n```\nYou can try out this example by creating your own `camelot.txt` and `example.py` files with the text above.\n\nEach time we called `read` on the file with an integer argument, it read up to that number of characters, outputted them, and kept the 'window' at that position for the next call to `read`. This makes moving around in the open file a little tricky, as there aren't many landmarks to navigate by.\n\n### Reading Line by Line\n`\\n`s in blocks of text are newline characters. The newline character marks the end of a line, and tells a program (such as a text editor) to go down to the next line.

              "text": "# Importing Local Scripts\nWe can actually import Python code from other scripts, which is helpful if you are working on a bigger project where you want to organize your code into multiple files and reuse code in those files. If the Python script you want to import is in the same directory as your current script, you just type `import` followed by the name of the file, without the .py extension. \n```python\nimport useful_functions\n```\nIt's the standard convention for `import` statements to be written at the top of a Python script, each one on a separate line. This `import` statement creates a __module__ object called `useful_functions`. Modules are just Python files that contain definitions and statements.  To access objects from an imported module, you need to use dot notation.\n```python\nimport useful_functions\nuseful_functions.add_five([1, 2, 3, 4])\n```\nWe can add an alias to an imported module to reference it with a different name.\n```python\nimport useful_functions as uf\nuf.add_five([1, 2, 3, 4])\n```\n### Using a main block\nTo avoid running executable statements in a script when it's imported as a module in another script, include these lines in an `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` block. Or alternatively, include them in a function called main() and call this in the `if main` block.\n\nWhenever we run a script like this, Python actually sets a special built-in variable called `__name__` for any module. When we run a script, Python recognizes this module as the main program, and sets the `__name__` variable for this module to the string `\"__main__\"`. For any modules that are imported in this script, this built-in `__name__` variable is just set to the name of that module. Therefore, the condition `if __name__ == \"__main__\"`is just checking whether this module is the main program. \n",

To help you get familiar with what's available, here are a selection of our favourite Python Standard Library modules and why we use them! \n\n* [`csv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html): very convenient for reading and writing csv files  \n* [`collections`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html): useful extensions of the usual data types including `OrderedDict`, `defaultdict` and `namedtuple`  \n* [`random`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html): generates pseudo-random numbers, shuffles sequences randomly and chooses random items  \n* [`string`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html): more functions on strings. This module also contains useful collections of letters like `string.digits` (a string containing all characters which are valid digits).  \n* [`re`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html): pattern-matching in strings via regular expressions  \n* [`math`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html): some standard mathematical functions  \n* [`os`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html): interacting with operating systems  \n* [`os.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html): submodule of `os` for manipulating path names  \n* [`sys`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html): work directly with the Python interpreter  \n* [`json`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html): good for reading and writing json files (good for web work)\n\nWe hope you find these useful!",

You can install them using pip, a package manager that is included with Python 3. pip is the standard package manager for Python, but it isn't the only one. One popular alternative is Anaconda which is designed specifically for data science.\n\nTo install a package using pip, just enter \"pip install\" followed by the name of the package in your command line like this: `pip install package_name`. This downloads and installs the package so that it's available to import in your programs. Once installed, you can import third-party packages using the same syntax used to import from the standard library.\n\n### Using a `requirements.txt` File\nLarger Python programs might depend on dozens of third party packages. To make it easier to share these programs, programmers often list a project's dependencies in a file called requirements.txt. This is an example of a requirements.txt file.\n```txt\nbeautifulsoup4==4.5.1\nbs4==0.0.1\npytz==2016.7\nrequests==2.11.1\n```\nEach line of the file includes the name of a package and its version number. The version number is optional, but it usually should be included. Libraries can change subtly, or dramatically, between versions, so it's important to use the same library versions that the program's author used when they wrote the program.\n\nYou can use pip to install all of a project's dependencies at once by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your command line.\n",

If you're a new Python programmer you may not have many colleagues, so to get you started here's a list of packages that are popular with engineers at Udacity.\n\n* [IPython](https://ipython.org/) - A better interactive Python interpreter  \n* [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/) - Provides easy to use methods to make web requests. Useful for accessing web APIs.  \n* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - a lightweight framework for making web applications and APIs.  \n* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - A more featureful framework for making web applications. Django is particularly good for designing complex, content heavy, web applications.  \n* [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) - Used to parse HTML and extract information from it.

You can type here to interact with Python directly. This is an awesome place to experiment and try bits of Python code at a time. Just enter Python code, and the output will appear on the next line.\n\n```\n>>> type(5.23)\n<class 'float'>\n```\nIn the interpreter, the value of the last line in a prompt will be outputted automatically. If you had multiple lines where you’d want to output values, you’d still have to use print.\n\nIf you start to define a function you will see a change in the prompt, to signify that this is a continuation line. You'll have to include your own indentation as you define the function.\n\n```\n>>> def cylinder_volume(height, radius):\n...         pi = 3.14159\n...         return height * pi * radius ** 2\n```\n\nA drawback of the interpreter is that it’s tricky to edit code. If you made a mistake when typing this function, or forgot to indent the body of the function, you can't use the mouse to click your cursor where you want it. You have to navigate with arrow keys to move the cursor forwards and backwards through the line itself for editing. It would be helpful for you to learn useful shortcuts for actions like moving to the beginning or end of the line.\n\nNotice I can reference any objects I defined earlier in the interpreter!\n\n```\n>>> cylinder_volume(10, 3)\n282.7431\n```\nOne useful trick is using the up and down arrow to cycle through your recent commands at the interactive prompt. This can be useful to re-run or adapt code you've already tried.\n\nTo quit the Python interactive interpreter, use the command `exit()` or hit `ctrl-D` on mac or linux, and `ctrl-Z` then `Enter` for windows.\n\n### IPython\nThere is actually an awesome alternative to the default Python interactive interpreter, IPython, which comes with many additional features.\n- tab completion\n- `?` for details about an object\n- `!` to execute system shell commands\n-  syntax highlighting!\n\nand a lot more you can find [here](https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/interactive/tutorial.html)! \n",

This tells the search engine to prioritize results that are explicitly related to the tools you're using.\n* Writing a good search query can take multiple attempts. If you don't find helpful results on your first attempt, try again. \n* Try using keywords found on the pages you found in your initial search to direct the search engine to better resources in the subsequent search.\n* Copy and paste error messages to use as search terms. This will lead you to explanations of the error and potential causes. An error message might include references to specific line numbers of code that you wrote. Only include the part of the error message that comes before this in your search.\n* If you can't find an answer to your question, ask it yourself! Communities like StackOverflow have etiquette rules you must learn if you want to participate, but don't let this stop you from using these resources.",

This list of resources is in approximate order of reliability.\n\n1. **[The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)** - This section of the official documentation surveys Python's syntax and standard library. It uses examples, and is written using less technical language than the main documentation. Make sure you're reading the Python 3 version of the docs!\n2. **[The Python Language and Library References](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html)** - The Language Reference and Library Reference are more technical than the tutorial, but they are the definitive sources of truth. As you become increasingly acquainted with Python you should use these resources more and more.\n3. **Third-Party Library Documentation** - Third-party libraries publish their documentation on their own websites, and often times at https://readthedocs.org/. You can judge the quality of a third-party library by the quality of its documentation. If the developers haven't found time to write good docs, they probably haven't found the time to polish their library either.\n4. **The websites and blogs of prominent experts** - The previous resources are primary sources, meaning that they are documentation from the same people who wrote the code being documented. Primary sources are the most reliable. Secondary sources are also extremely valuable. The difficulty with secondary sources is determining the credibility of the source. The websites of authors like [Doug Hellmann](https://doughellmann.com/blog/) and developers like [Eli Bendersky](http://eli.thegreenplace.net/) are excellent. The blog of an unknown author might be excellent, or it might be rubbish.\n5. **[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)** - This question and answer site has a good amount of traffic, so it's likely that someone has asked (and someone has answered) a related question before! However, answers are provided by volunteers and vary in quality. Always understand solutions before putting them into your program. One line answers without any explanation are dubious. This is a good place to find out more about your question or discover alternative search terms.\n6. **Bug Trackers** - Sometimes you'll encounter a problem so rare, or so new, that no one has addressed it on StackOverflow. You might find a reference to your error in a bug report on GitHub for instance. These bug reports can be helpful, but you'll probably have to do some original engineering work to solve the problem.\n7. **Random Web Forums** - Sometimes your search yields references to forums that haven't been active since 2004, or some similarly ancient time. If these are the only resources that address your problem, you should rethink how you're approaching your solution.\n",
