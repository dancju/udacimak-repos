        "description": "# Plagiarism Detection\n\n## Project Overview\n\nIn this project, you will be tasked with building a plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification; labeling that file as either plagiarized or not, depending on how similar the text file is to a provided source text.\n\n## Getting the Project Materials\n\nYou have been given starting notebooks in a Github repository, linked below.\n\n> Since this project uses SageMaker, it is suggested that you create a new SageMaker notebook instance using your [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) and link it to the Github repository [https://github.com/udacity/ML_SageMaker_Studies](https://github.com/udacity/ML_SageMaker_Studies).\n\n**The project files are in the `Project_Plagiarism_Detection` directory.**\n\nYou should complete each exercise and question; your project will be evaluated against [this rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2516/view).\n\n## Submission and Project Evaluation\n\nYou will be graded on your implementation of a plagiarism detector as well as complete answers to any questions in the project notebook. You'll submit a **zip file** or Github repo that includes complete notebooks, with all cells executed, and you'll be graded according to the project rubric.\n\n1. Ensure you've passed all the unit tests in the notebook.\n2. Ensure you pass all points on [the rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2516/view).\n3. When you're done with the project, please save the last two notebooks, \"2_Plagiarism_Feature_Engineering.ipynb\" and \"3_Training_a_Model.ipynb\", making sure you've run all cells. You can do this by going to the **File** menu in the notebook and choosing \"Download\". \n4. Package \"2_Plagiarism_Feature_Engineering.ipynb\", \"3_Training_a_Model.ipynb\", \"problem_unittests.py\", \"helpers.py\", and at least *one*, complete training directory (`source_sklearn` or `source_pytorch`) into a zip archive, or push the files from your GitHub repo.\n  \nNote that the zip file should **not** include the large `data` or any generated data repositories; this would make your submission too large to download and manage.\n\nOnce you have all of your project files in one zip file, you click `Submit` and follow the instructions for uploading your complete project!\n\n## Project Submission Checklist\n\n**Before submitting your project, please review and confirm the following items.** \n<input type=\"checkbox\"> I am confident all rubric items have been met and my project will pass as submitted. \n<input type=\"checkbox\"> Project builds correctly without errors and runs.\n<input type=\"checkbox\"> All required functionality exists and my project behaves as expected per the project's specifications.\n\n**Once you have checked all these items, you are ready to submit!**\n",

You can develop as many features as you want and are required to define a couple as outlined in [this paper](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/January/5c412841_developing-a-corpus-of-plagiarised-short-answers/developing-a-corpus-of-plagiarised-short-answers.pdf) (which is also linked in the Lesson Resources tab. In this paper, researchers created features called **containment** and **longest common subsequence**.\n\nIn the next few sections, which explain how these features are calculated, I'll refer to a submitted text file (the one we want to label as plagiarized or not) as a **Student Answer Text** and an original, wikipedia source file (that we want to compare that answer to) as the **Wikipedia Source Text**.\n",

You'll submit a **zip file** or Github repo that includes complete notebooks, with all cells executed, and you'll be graded according to the project rubric.",
