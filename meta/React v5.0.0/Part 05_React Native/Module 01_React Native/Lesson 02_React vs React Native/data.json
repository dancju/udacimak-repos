              "text": "Native applications look and \"feel\" different because they are _fundamentally_ different. Even though we're using the same React principles that you've learned throughout this program, keep in mind that this is no longer the web! While some of these distinctions are more apparent (e.g., the development process, access to native features, how users get updates, etc.), there are some key differences that we'll be taking a deep dive into during this course.\n\nFor one, native apps often leverage **animations** to help create a great user experience. Animations such as button effects, screen transitions, and other visual feedback may be subtle, but they support continuity and guidance in the apps you build. They all function to dynamically _tell a story_ about how your application works. Without animations, an application can feel like just a collection of static screens. For now, stay tuned; we'll be checking out animations in-depth during Lesson 5.\n\nAnother key difference between native and web applications is in **navigation**. Recall that React Router's `Route` component allows us to map a URL to a specific UI component. In React Native, routers function as a _stack_; that is, individual screens are \"pushed\" and \"popped\" as needed. We'll look at routing more closely later in Lesson 4.\n",

              "text": "## Android vs. iOS\n\nNot only are there fundamental differences between _native_ apps and _web_ apps, you'll also find differences between how native platforms (iOS and Android) _look and feel_ as well. Perhaps the most apparent are the distinct design philosophies on each platform: Android apps utilize Google's [Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/introduction.html), while iOS apps take advantage of Apple's [Human Interface Design](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/themes/). When designing mobile applications, it's important to your users that an iOS app _feels_ like an iOS app, and an Android app _feels_ like an Android app.\n\nNavigation _between_ screens feels distinct between Android and iOS as well. Android devices have access to a **navigation bar** at the bottom of the screen, which allows users to go back to the previous screen (among other features). On iOS, the approach is different: there is no such universal navigation bar! When building the UI for an iOS application, it is important to include a back button (perhaps on a custom [navigation bar](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/bars/navigation-bars/)) to help guide users through your app.\n\nOne more key difference between Android and iOS involves tab navigation. iOS apps include [tab bars](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/bars/tab-bars/) at the bottom of the app's screen, allowing for convenient access to different portions of the app. Likewise, Android apps include them as well; however tabs are distinctly located [at the top of the screen](https://material.io/guidelines/components/tabs.html). Both allow access to high-level content, and we'll explore React Native's **TabNavigator** in closer detail in Lesson 4.",

Mobile applications look and _feel_ different due to fundamental differences, such as subtle animations that build a sense of continuity for your users. Differences exist between Android and iOS as well, especially in their design philosophies and navigation.

On the other hand, `onChange` passes the entire event object as an argument. Both are perfectly valid props, but the logic of your event handler will need to be tailored to the prop chosen.

Basic functionality allows users to add items to their task list, remove items, and mark items as completed. \n\nAssuming much of this data is kept in the application's store, how would we go about persisting this data? One way would be to save to `localStorage` each time that state is updated. That is, the store's state will be saved with each _dispatch_:\n\n```js\n// store.js\n\nimport { createStore } from 'redux';\nimport Reducer from '../reducers/reducer';\n\nconst configureStore = () => {\n  const store = createStore(Reducer);\n\n  store.subscribe(() => {\n    localStorage.state = JSON.stringify(store.getState());\n  });\n\n  return store;\n};\n\nexport default configureStore;\n```\n\nAfter the store is created, we call `store.subscribe()` and pass in a callback function. The callback effectively saves a JSON string of the store's state into `localStorage`. As a result, by subscribing to the store right after it is created, we can save data related to all of the user's tasks right into their browser!\n",
