              "text": "### Topics Covered\n\nThere are a lot of ways you can interact with data using Tableau.  This lesson is going to cover **A LOT** of information.  Don't worry if you don't memorize where everything is stored.  The goal is to gain familiarity with Tableau, so you aren't afraid to explore beyond the course materials on your own.\n\nEven the below summary might seem overwhelming.  It is just here to assist as a nice template of what is to come.  Don't worry if you don't follow it all right now.  That is what this lesson is for!\n\nWith that, here are the areas this lesson will cover:\n\n______\n\n#### I. Connecting to Data\n\nIn this section, you will get started with importing data into Tableau.  Tableau public has fewer options, but paid versions of Tableau are quite extensive connecting directly to databases and cloud based data storage systems.\n\n#### II. Combining Data\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to connect data from multiple sources for use in your visuals.  If you are comfortable with SQL joins, this section should be second nature.\n\n#### III. Worksheets\n\nThe visuals you create will be stored in worksheets.  This is the template we will be working in for this course.\n\n#### IV. Aggregations\n\nTableau performs aggregations of our data by default.  In this section, you will learn more about how to work with different aggregations, as well as how to break your aggregations into a more granular level of the data.\n\n#### V. Hierarchies\n\nHierarchies allow you to 'drill' into your data and questions at different levels.  One of the easiest ways to think of hierarchies is in relation to time.  You could look at your data at a year, month, day, hour, or another level.  Moving across these levels is considered working with hierarchies.\n\nYou can also perform hierarchical calculations in other ways.  Imagine you have different companies, with different departments, and teams within those departments.  This creates a hierarchy that you might want to analyze at different levels.  \n\n#### VI. Marks & Filters\n\nFiltering is one of the most powerful techniques in creating dashboards.  This relates to the marks portion of a dashboard, which controls the colors, shapes and other attributes of our data.  You can think of this like a WHERE statement in SQL used to filter your data to only the parts you are interested in for a specific question.\n\n#### VII. Show Me\n\nThe Show Me portion of Tableau controls what your ending visual looks like.  There are a lot of options here.  In most cases, Tableau will guess what visual you want to create, but sometimes you might have your own ideas for implementation.\n\n#### VIII.  Small Multiples & Dual Axis\n\nSmall multiples & dual charts are a way to visualize data that needs to share an axis for comparison purposes.  [This](http://www.evolytics.com/blog/tableau-201-how-to-make-small-multiples/) and [this](http://kb.tableau.com/articles/HowTo/dual-axis-bar-chart-multiple-measures) are great articles for explaining how these two parts of Tableau work and why you might use them.\n\n#### IX. Groups & Sets\n\nGroups and sets are two ways to categorize our data within a visualization.  The difference between these two can be confusing, but we will see when and why you would use each.\n\n#### X. Calculated Fields\n\nOften you might add these fields to your dataset before adding your data to Tableau, but sometimes you want to add them to a visualization on the fly.  Many of these calculated fields are things you have probably done in a spreadsheet application like finding a total or a cost per item.\n\n#### XI. Table Calculations\n\nTable calculations are often used to perform comparisons of our data over time or between groups.  A great article on table calculations is available [here](https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2017/2/top-10-tableau-table-calculations-65417).\n\n______\n\n#### Final Thoughts\n\nAgain, don't worry if this seems daunting right now.  Use this as a resource for what to Google if you get stuck (as the headings are the names Tableau uses - for example **Tableau Table Calculations** will provide more information on the final part we will discuss) and also as a guide for what is to come!\n",

On the other hand, the period will be used as the decimal separator, as you can see from these previous numbers.\n\nYou may want to assure that you are following along with these same conventions, or at least be aware of the differences you may see should you be using a different convention for commas and decimals.\n\nPotential Solutions\nAfter importing the data set into Tableau click Sheet 1 tab.

For example, you might want to include the information from the *People* sheet with the *Orders* sheet so you can analyze the performance of each salesperson.\n\nIn Tableau, you can do this by dragging multiple sheets into the top panel. You get two different outcomes depending on where you drag it, a **union** or a **join**.\n\n### Union\n\nIf you drag *People* below *Orders*, you get a union. Unions stack the data on top of each other, the second sheet ends up being appended to the end of the first sheet. This works great if you have multiple sheets with columns in common as the columns will match up. However if the columns are different, then you'll get a lot of \"nulls\" because columns are created for both sheets, but the first sheet doesn't have data for the second sheet's columns.\n\n\n",

Above you can see the **Person** column from *People* has been added to the data from *Orders*.\n\nYou can click on the join symbol to change the type of join being performed. In this case you can also select the \"left inner join.\" The normal inner join combines only data that is common, but the left inner join returns all the data in the original sheet setting rows not common to *null*.\n\n It's important to understand joins because you'll be combining data often.

Remember that discrete data can only be certain values like integers or categories, while continuous data can be any value. \n\nDimensions aren't required to be discrete and measures aren't required to be continuous. You can convert discrete data to continuous in some cases, such as with time. Right click the field, or click the little triangle to bring up the menu.

The first thing we'll do is create a simple scatter plot to see how some measures are related. I expect that the more items sold, the higher the profit will be, so let’s look at profit vs quantity.\n\nTry it out yourself. You see just one point! What’s going on? Why isn’t there a point for each record in the data set? \n\n## Aggregation\n\nWhen I was first learning Tableau, I couldn't understand why I was only seeing one point when I thought I'd see a bunch of points. The answer is how Tableau aggregates the data. You should see in the pills that Tableau is taking the sums of Quantity and Profit. This is called an aggregation. It is summing Quantity and Profit over all records in the data set, this is why you are seeing only one dot. There is one sum over all the records for Quantity and one sum over all the records for Profit.\n\nThe kind of aggregation you're doing can be selected by right clicking on the pill or clicking the triangle. To change the aggregation method, select Measure then Sum, Average, Median, and others.\n\n",

That is, each value is the sum of Profit for that month over the four years in the data.\n\nHowever, I'd typically like to see this as one long line over all four years.

For instance, if you want to point out the products that are losing money, you'd want to create a group of those products and color them separately from the positive profit products.\n\n## Groups\n\nGroups are typically created from the view by selecting multiple data points in the view.

For instance, maybe you want to know the profit per item for each order record. It seems pretty simple, just divide profit by order for each record, then aggregate it, but how do you actually do the division in Tableau?\n\nThe answer is **calculated fields**. Calculated fields let you create new fields to use in your visualizations. If you have experience working with formulas in Excel, creating calculated fields should feel pretty similar.\n\nTo create a calculated field, open the menu on a field (such as **Profit**), then Create > Calculated Field.... (See below). You can also create one by clicking on \"Analysis\" in the top menu bar, then selected \"Create Calculated Field...\"",

              "text": "At the row level, the two calculations are the same. It's the averaging of the [Profit]/[Quantity] calculation that is causing the difference. For the the \"Atlantic Mobile 4-Shelf Bookcases\" product, all the ratios are correct. But when you average them, (28-112+28+42+28+42)/6 = 9.333, you get what we see at the product name level. \n\nThe aggregation in the other calculation takes care of that for us. It always calculates the ratios for the level of granularity we're at. You can see the columns `Profit` and `Quantity` doing the summation at the level of granularity and the ratio `SUM([Profit])/SUM([Quantity])` is taken from those numbers.\n\nThe two calculations are answering different questions. \n\n1. What is the profit ratio for a *single order* within any product or any other category level?\n  * Use Average `[Profit]/[Quantity]` \n\n2. What is the profit ratio at any level of a category?\n  * Use `SUM([Profit])/SUM([Quantity])`\n\nIt's important to make sure you are answering the right question when working with data! \n\n## Conditional statements\n\nAs in Excel and most programming languages, you can use conditional statements like `IF`, `THEN`, `ELSE` in calculations. For example to make a new field to categorize sales as \"good\" and bad\", you could do:\n\n`IF SUM([Sales]) > 10000 THEN \"Good\" ELSE \"Bad\"`\n\nYou'll use this pattern a lot, there is a short hand version with the function `IIF`. The function works like `IIF(conditions, if true, if false)`\n\n`IIF(SUM([Sales]) > 10000, \"Good\", \"Bad\")`\n\n## Calculations with strings\n\nMuch of the time you'll find yourself working with strings (text) like the product names in this data set. In calculations, you can do things like split up words in a string, find words in a string, and concatenate strings.\n\nHere's a great [tutorial video from Tableau](http://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/string-calculations) and [a blog post](http://www.clearlyandsimply.com/clearly_and_simply/2014/06/string-calculations-in-tableau.html) with a bunch of in depth examples.\n\n## More on calculated fields\n\nThere is a lot to learn about calculate fields that's outside the scope of this lesson. If you want to know more about calculated fields, the [Tableau documentation](https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/calculations_calculatedfields.html) is a great place to start. As you're working with Tableau, be sure to visit the documentation often.",

You have come a long way in a short amount of time, and you should feel comfortable navigating the many facets of the Tableau environment!\n\nBelow are the topics that were covered in this section.  In the next section, you will watch a professional navigate Tableau to gain a few tips, and you will see a few advanced features of Tableau like **dashboards** and **stories**\n\n______\n\n### Topics Covered\n\nThere are a lot of ways you can interact with data using Tableau.  This lesson is going to cover **A LOT** of information.  Don't worry if you don't memorize where everything is stored.  The goal is to gain familiarity with Tableau, so you aren't afraid to explore beyond the course materials on your own.\n\nEven the below summary might seem overwhelming.  It is just here to assist as a nice template of what is to come.  Don't worry if you don't follow it all right now.  That is what this lesson is for!\n\nWith that, here are the areas this lesson will cover:\n\n#### I. Connecting to Data\n\nIn this section, you will get started with importing data into Tableau.  Tableau public has fewer options, but paid versions of Tableau are quite extensive connecting directly to databases and cloud based data storage systems.\n\n#### II. Combining Data\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to connect data from multiple sources for use in your visuals.  If you are comfortable with SQL joins, this section should be second nature.\n\n#### III. Worksheets\n\nThe visuals you create will be stored in worksheets.  This is the template we will be working in for this course.\n\n#### IV. Aggregations\n\nTableau performs aggregations of our data by default.  In this section, you will learn more about how to work with different aggregations, as well as how to break your aggregations into a more granular level of the data.\n\n#### V. Hierarchies\n\nHierarchies allow you to 'drill' into your data and questions at different levels.  One of the easiest ways to think of hierarchies is in relation to time.  You could look at your data at a year, month, day, hour, or another level.  Moving across these levels is considered working with hierarchies.\n\nYou can also perform hierarchical calculations in other ways.  Imagine you have a different companies, with different departments, and teams within those departments.  This creates a hierarchy that you might want to analyze at different levels.  \n\n#### VI. Marks & Filters\n\nFiltering is one of the most powerful techniques in creating dashboards.  This relates to the marks portion of a dashboard, which controls the colors, shapes and other attributes of our data.  You can think of this like a WHERE statement in SQL used to filter your data to only the parts you are interested in for a specific question.\n\n#### VII. Show Me\n\nThe Show Me portion of Tableau controls what your ending visual looks like.  There are a lot of options here.  In most cases, Tableau will guess what visual you want to create, but sometimes you might have your own ideas for implementation.\n\n#### VIII.  Small Multiples & Dual Axis\n\nSmall multiples & dual charts are a way to visualize data that needs to share an axis for comparison purposes.  [This](http://www.evolytics.com/blog/tableau-201-how-to-make-small-multiples/) and [this](https://kb.tableau.com/articles/howto/dual-axis-bar-chart-multiple-measures) are great articles for explaining how these two parts of Tableau work and why you might use them.\n\n#### IX. Groups & Sets\n\nGroups and sets are two ways to categorize our data within a visualization.  The difference between these two can be confusing, but we will see when and why you would use each.\n\n#### X. Calculated Fields\n\nOften you might add these fields to your dataset before adding your data to Tableau, but sometimes you want to add them to a visualization on the fly.  Many of these calculated fields are things you have probably done in a spreadsheets application like finding a total or a cost per item.\n\n#### XI. Table Calculations\n\nTable calculations are often used to perform comparisons of our data over time or between groups.  A great article on table calculations is available [here](https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2017/2/top-10-tableau-table-calculations-65417).\n\n_______\n\n#### Final Thoughts\n\nThese shouldn't feel so daunting anymore.  To continue learning about Tableau, definitely feel free to practice any of the previous concepts, but also check out the content on [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/learn/training).  Creating an account is free, and they have a ton of resources to help you continue advancing your skills!\n",
