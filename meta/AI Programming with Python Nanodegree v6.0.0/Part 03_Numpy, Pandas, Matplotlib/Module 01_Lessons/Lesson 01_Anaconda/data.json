With Anaconda, it's simple to install the packages you'll often use in data science work. You'll also use it to create virtual environments that make working on multiple projects much less mind-twisting. Anaconda has simplified my workflow and solved a lot of issues I had dealing with packages and multiple Python versions. \n\nAnaconda is actually a distribution of software that comes with `conda`, Python, and over 150 scientific packages and their dependencies. The application `conda` is a package and environment manager. Anaconda is a fairly large download (~500 MB) because it comes with the most common data science packages in Python. If you don't need all the packages or need to conserve bandwidth or storage space,  there is also **Miniconda**, a smaller distribution that includes only `conda` and Python. Miniconda can do everything Anaconda does, but doesn't have the preinstalled packages. You can still install any of the available packages with `conda`, it just doesn't come with them, so either Anaconda or Miniconda are fine for this course.\n\n`Conda` is a program you'll be using exclusively from the command line, so if you aren't comfortable using it, check out this [command prompt tutorial for Windows](https://www.lynda.com/-tutorials/Windows-command-line-basics/497312/513424-4.html) or our [Linux Command Line Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/linux-command-line-basics--ud595) course for OSX/Linux.\n\nYou probably already have Python installed and wonder why you need this at all. First, since Anaconda comes with a bunch of data science packages, you'll be all set to start working with data. Secondly, using `conda` to manage your packages and environments will reduce future issues dealing with the various libraries you'll be using.\n\n## Managing Packages\n\n\n\n\n",

You’re probably already familiar with pip, it’s the default package manager for Python libraries. Conda is similar to pip except that the available packages are focused around data science while pip is for general use. However, conda is *not* Python specific like pip is, it can also install non-Python packages. It is a package manager for *any* software stack. That being said, not all Python libraries are available from the Anaconda distribution and conda. You can (and will) still use pip alongside conda to install packages.\n\nConda installs precompiled packages. For example, the Anaconda distribution comes with Numpy, Scipy and Scikit-learn compiled with the [MKL library](https://docs.continuum.io/mkl-optimizations/), speeding up various math operations. The packages are maintained by contributors to the distribution which means they usually lag behind new releases. But because someone needed to build the packages for many systems, they tend to be more stable (and more convenient for you).\n\n## Environments",

It's similar to [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) and [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv), other popular environment managers. \n\nEnvironments allow you to separate and isolate the packages you are using for different projects. Often you’ll be working with code that depends on different versions of some library. For example, you could have code that uses new features in Numpy, or code that uses old features that have been removed. It’s practically impossible to have two versions of Numpy installed at once. Instead, you should make an environment for each version of Numpy then work in the appropriate environment for the project.\n\nThis issue also happens a lot when dealing with Python 2 and Python 3. You might be working with old code that doesn’t run in Python 3 and new code that doesn’t run in Python 2. Having both installed can lead to a lot of confusion and bugs. It’s much better to have separate environments.\n\nYou can also export the list of packages in an environment to a file, then include that file with your code. This allows other people to easily load all the dependencies for your code. Pip has similar functionality with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.\n\n## Where we go from here\nNext, I'll get into the details of using Anaconda.

You can find the installers at [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and the installation instructions [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). \n\nIf you already have Python installed on your computer, this won't break anything. Instead, the default Python used by your scripts and programs will be the one that comes with Anaconda.\n\nChoose the Python 3.7 version, you can install Python 2 versions later. Also, choose the 64-bit installer if you have a 64-bit operating system, otherwise go with the 32-bit installer. Go ahead and choose the appropriate version, then install it. Continue on afterwards!\n\nAfter installation, you’re automatically in the default conda environment with all packages installed which you can see below. You can check out your own install by entering `conda list` into your terminal.\n\n<video loop autoplay>\n  <source src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/ud1111/conda_default_install.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n\n## On Windows\nA bunch of applications are installed along with Anaconda:\n\n* **Anaconda Navigator**, a GUI for managing your environments and packages\n* **Anaconda Prompt**, a terminal where you can use the command line interface to manage your environments and packages\n* **Spyder**, an IDE geared toward scientific development\n\nTo avoid errors later, it's best to update all the packages in the default environment. Open the **Anaconda Prompt** application. In the prompt, run the following commands:\n\n    conda upgrade conda\n    conda upgrade --all\n\nand answer yes when asked if you want to install the packages. The packages that come with the initial install tend to be out of date, so updating them now will prevent future errors from out of date software.\n\n**Note:** In the previous step, running `conda upgrade conda` should not be necessary because `--all` includes the conda package itself, but some users have encountered errors without it.\n\nIn the rest of this lesson, I'll be asking you to use commands in your terminal. I highly suggest you start working with Anaconda this way, then later use the GUI if you'd like. \n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you are seeing the following \"conda command not found\" and are using ZShell, you have to do the following:\n* Add `export PATH=\"/Users/username/anaconda/bin:$PATH\"` to your .zsh_config file.\n",

              "text": "# Managing Packages\n\nOnce you have Anaconda installed, managing packages is fairly straightforward. To install a package, type `conda install package_name` in your terminal. For example, to install numpy, type `conda install numpy`.\n\n<video controls loop autoplay>\n  <source src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/ud1111/conda_install.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n\nYou can install multiple packages at the same time. Something like `conda install numpy scipy pandas` will install all those packages simultaneously. It's also possible to specify which version of a package you want by adding the version number such as `conda install numpy=1.10`.\n\nConda also automatically installs dependencies for you. For example `scipy` depends on `numpy`, it uses and requires `numpy`. If you install just `scipy` (`conda install scipy`), Conda will also install `numpy` if it isn't already installed.\n\nMost of the commands are pretty intuitive. To uninstall, use `conda remove package_name`. To update a package `conda update package_name`. If you want to update all packages in an environment, which is often useful, use `conda update --all`. And finally, to list installed packages, it's `conda list` which you've seen before.\n\nIf you don't know the exact name of the package you're looking for, you can try searching with `conda search *search_term*`. For example, I know I want to install [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), but I'm not sure of the exact package name. So, I try `conda search *beautifulsoup*`. Note that your shell might expand the wildcard `*` before running the conda command. To fix this, wrap the search string in single or double quotes like `conda search '*beautifulsoup*'`.\n",

This is useful when you're working with code in both Python 2.x and Python 3.x. To create an environment with a specific Python version, do something like `conda create -n py3 python=3` or `conda create -n py2 python=2`. I actually have both of these environments on my personal computer. I use them as general environments not tied to any specific project, but rather for general work with each Python version easily accessible. These commands will install the most recent version of Python 3 and 2, respectively. To install a specific version, use `conda create -n py python=3.3` for Python 3.3.\n\n## Entering an environment\n\nOnce you have an environment created, use `conda activate my_env` to enter it.\n\n<video controls loop autoplay>\n<source src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/ud1111/conda_enter.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n\nWhen you're in the environment, you'll see the environment name in the terminal prompt. Something like `(my_env) ~ $`. The environment has only a few packages installed by default, plus the ones you installed when creating it. You can check this out with `conda list`. Installing packages in the environment is the same as before: `conda install package_name`. Only this time, the specific packages you install will only be available when you're in the environment. To leave the environment, type `conda deactivate` (on OSX/Linux). On Windows, use `deactivate`.\n\n**Note**: `conda activate` and `conda deactivate` only work on conda 4.6 and later versions. For conda versions prior to 4.6, run `activate` or `deactivate` (on Windows), `source activate` or `source deactivate` (on OSX/Linux)",

I used `conda create -n py2 python=2` and `conda create -n py3 python=3` to create two separate environments, `py2` and `py3`. Now I have a general use environment for each Python version. In each of those environments, I've installed most of the standard data science packages (numpy, scipy, pandas, etc.). Remember that when you set up an environment initially, you'll only start with the standard packages and whatever packages you specify in your `conda create` statement.\n\nI’ve also found it useful to create environments for each project I’m working on. It works great for non-data related projects too like web apps with Flask. For example, I have an environment for my personal blog using [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/). \n\n## Sharing environments\n\nWhen sharing your code on GitHub, it's good practice to make an environment file and include it in the repository. This will make it easier for people to install all the dependencies for your code. I also usually include a pip `requirements.txt` file using `pip freeze` ([learn more here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_freeze/)) for people not using conda.\n\n## More to learn\n\nTo learn more about conda and how it fits in the Python ecosystem, check out this article by Jake Vanderplas: [Conda myths and misconceptions](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2016/08/25/conda-myths-and-misconceptions/). And here's the [conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda) you can reference later, and a link to a [cheatsheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html) to help you basic conda commands.\n",

All new Python code should be written for version 3. Read more [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3).\n\n## The main breakage between Python 2 and 3\n\nFor the most part, Python 2 code will work with Python 3. Of course, most new features introduced with Python 3 versions won't be backwards compatible. The place where your Python 2 code will fail most often is the `print` statement.\n\nFor most of Python's history including Python 2, printing was done like so:\n\n    print \"Hello\", \"world!\"\n    > Hello world!\n\nThis was changed in Python 3 to a function.\n\n    print(\"Hello\", \"world!\")\n    > Hello world!\n\nThe `print` function was back-ported to Python 2 in version 2.6 through the `__future__` module:\n```python\n    # In Python 2.6+\n    from __future__ import print_function\n    print(\"Hello\", \"world!\")\n    > Hello world!\n```\nThe `print` statement doesn't work in Python 3. If you want to print something and have it work in both Python versions, you'll need to import `print_function` in your Python 2 code.",
