This project will become an important part of your portfolio to share with current and future colleagues and employers.\n\nIn this project, you will build a C++ application, following the principles you have learned throughout this Nanodegree Program. This project will demonstrate that you can independently create applications using a wide range of C++ features.\n\nYou can choose from two possible options for this capstone project:\n\n## Capstone Option 1\n\nThe first option is to build the project of your choice. This is the most flexible option, as this will allow you to focus on the type of application that interests you most. There are a wide variety of applications you can choose from, but here are some suggestions for you to think about:\n- Chatbot\n- Neural network deployment\n- Solitaire\n- Microcontroller for an embedded system\n- ROS Node simulated in Gazebo\n- Networking protocol\n- Mandelbrot or Fractal creator\n- Hot dog detector using OpenCV\n- Video game\n\nThere are a wide variety of existing projects and tutorials online that can help you get started, and we'll provide some links below to help. We'll also provide a code repository with a CMakeLists.txt and a \"Hello World\" application that you can build from. You can use this repo to get started if you wish, but you aren't required to use it.\n\n## Capstone Option 2\n\nThe second option for the capstone is to add features to a video game. We'll provide you with a simple 2D Snake game that was inspired by [this Stack Overflow post](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) on beginning game development with the SDL game programming library. The game code provides a solid foundation for you to extend with additional features, or you are welcome to use the code as a framework to build you own game from scratch. If you decide to build your own game, cloning a classic 2D game is great way to get started. Possible ideas include:\n\n- Asteroids\n- Pacman\n- Space Invaders\n- Pong\n\nThe game you create doesn’t need to be a fully-featured clone of the original, but there should be enough of a game for a user to play.\n\nBoth project options will require a solid effort from you to complete, but I am confident that you will be successful, and we can't wait to see what you create!

Note that it is fine to reuse code from any of the courses in the Nanodegree as a starting point. You are also welcome to use the [Snake game sample code](https://github.com/udacity/CppND_Capstone_Snake_Game) to extend with additional features or to build an entirely different game. If you prefer to start from scratch, you can find a starter repo [here](https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Capstone-Hello-World).\n\n### Step 2: Scope the Project\nReview [the rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2533/view). Ensure that the application you build **will satisfy all criteria for the “README” and “Compiling and Testing” sections**, and that the application **will satisfy at least 5 total criteria from the rest of the rubric.  Not all rubric items need to be satisfied in order to pass the project**.  Scope the features of your project to meet the rubric criteria you want to target.\n\nThis flexibility will allow you to focus on the aspects of your application that interest you most.\n\n### Step 3: Build your application\nBuild your own application, or extend the Snake game with new features.\n\n### Step 4: Document Your Work\nWrite a short README indicating which project option you chose. The README should also include:\n- instructions for running the project\n- an overview of your code structure\n- an explanation of how your submission satisfies the necessary rubric",

Additionally, there an enormous number of libraries, platforms, tools, and languages that you can use to build a professional-quality game. While this might seem overwhelming at first, this _should not_ deter you from getting started with building your own game. The core tenets of game programming are nearly universal, and you will learn about the fundamental structure of game code in this concept.

If you want to change the appearance of your game without making major changes to how the game works, you can just update the Rendering code. Similarly, you are free to modify how the gameplay works without changing the rendering or input portion of the code at all.",

This implementation was inspired by code found in [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) StackOverflow post. \n\nIn this game, you control a snake using the keyboard, and the snake grows in speed and length each time it eats the food on the screen. Internally, the game state includes:\n- the speed of the snake\n- the current direction the snake is travelling\n- the `float` position of the snake's head\n- a `vector` of int coordinates representing the snake's body\n- the position of the food\n- other state data needed to make the game function\n\nAt each pass through the game loop, the steps \n1. **Input:** the keyboard input is handled and used to set the future direction of the snake.\n2. **Update:** The snake's position, length, and velocity are updated. If the snake has just eaten the food, a new food item is created.\n3. **Render:** The game state is drawn to the screen. The entire game loop happens approximately 60 times per second, so the rendering and motion look fairly smooth, even though every update is a discrete change to the game state.\n\nNote that the positions of the snake head and snake body are not stored in a 2D array in the current implementation, even though would also be a reasonable way to store some of the game state. However, the game is still rendered according to a 2D grid, and not using continuous coordinates. This happens even though the head coordinates are stored and updated with floats. By storing the head coordinates with floats, we can update the head position according to a fixed velocity. By rendering according to a grid, the vintage, grid-based aesthetic of the game can be maintained. \n\nTo make sure that you understand the game loop in the context of the Snake game, give the next few quizzes a try.\n\n## Snake Game Quizzes",
