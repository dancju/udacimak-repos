These workspaces provide a Jupyter notebook server directly in your browser. This lesson will briefly introduce the Workspaces interface.\n\n### Important Notes:\n\n- Workspaces sessions are connections from your browser to a remote server. Each student has a limited number of GPU hours allocated on the servers (the allocation is significantly more than completing the projects is expected to take). There is currently no limit on the number of Workspace hours when GPU mode is disabled.\n- Workspace data stored in the user's home folder is preserved between sessions (and can be reset as needed, e.g., to get project updates).\n- **Only 3 gigabytes of data can be stored in the home folder.**\n- Workspace sessions are preserved if your connection drops or your browser window is closed, simply return to the classroom and re-open the workspace page; however, workspace sessions are automatically terminated after a period of inactivity. This will prevent you from leaving a session connection open and burning through your time allocation. (See the section on active connections below.)\n- The kernel state is preserved as long as the notebook session remains open, but it is _not_ preserved if the session is closed. If you exit the notebook for more than half an hour and the session is closed, you will need to re-run any previously-run cells before continuing.\n\n## Overview\n---",

The \"Enable\"/\"Disable\" button (circled in red in the image) can be used to toggle GPU mode. **NOTE: Toggling GPU support may switch the physical server your session connects to, which can cause data loss UNLESS YOU CLICK THE SAVE BUTTON BEFORE TOGGLING GPU SUPPORT.**\n\n**NOTE THAT THIS WORKSPACE CANNOT BE RUN WITHOUT THE GPU SUPPORT.**\n\n**ALWAYS SAVE YOUR CHANGES BEFORE TOGGLING GPU SUPPORT.**\n\n## Keeping Your Session Active\n---\nWorkspaces automatically disconnect after 30 minutes of user inactivity—which means that workspaces can disconnect during long-running tasks (like training neural networks). We have provided a utility that can keep your workspace sessions active for these tasks. However, keep the following guidelines in mind:\n\n- Do not try to permanently hold the workspace session active when you do not have a process running (e.g., do not try to hold the session open in the background)—the limits are in place to preserve your GPU time allocation; there is no guarantee that you'll receive additional time if you exceed the limit.  \n- Make sure that you save the results of the long running task to disk as soon as the task ends (e.g., checkpoint your model parameters for deep learning networks); otherwise the workspace will disconnect 30 minutes after the active process ends, and the results will be lost.\n\nThe `workspace_utils.py` module (available [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/May/5b06f6c2_workspace-utils/workspace-utils.py)) includes an iterator wrapper called `keep_awake` and a context manager called `active_session` that can be used to maintain an active session during long-running processes. The two functions are equivalent, so use whichever fits better in your code.  **NOTE:** The file may be incorrectly downloaded as `workspace-utils.py` (note the dash instead of an underscore in the filename). Make sure to correct the filename before uploading to your workspace; Python cannot import from file names including hyphens.\n\nExample using `keep_awake`:\n```\nfrom workspace_utils import keep_awake\n\nfor i in keep_awake(range(5)):  #anything that happens inside this loop will keep the workspace active\n    # do iteration with lots of work here\n```\n\nExample using `active_session`:\n```\nfrom workspace_utils import active_session\n\nwith active_session():\n    # do long-running work here\n```\n\n## Submitting a Project\n---",

We'll provide some tips and guide you, but for the most part the code is left up to you. As you work through this project, please [refer to the rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1663/view) for guidance towards a successful submission.\n\nRemember that your code should be your own, please do not plagiarize ([see here](https://udacity.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001451091-What-is-plagiarism-) for more information).\n\nThis notebook will be required as part of the project submission. After you finish it, make sure you download it as an HTML file and include it with the files you write in the next part of the project.\n\nWe've provided you a workspace with a GPU for working on this project. If you'd instead prefer to work on your local machine, you can find the files [on GitHub here](https://github.com/udacity/aipnd-project).\n\nIf you are using the workspace, be aware that saving large files can create issues with backing up your work. You'll be saving a model checkpoint in Part 1 of this project which can be multiple GBs in size if you use a large classifier network. Dense networks can get large very fast since you are creating N x M weight matrices for each new layer. In general, it's better to avoid wide layers and instead use more hidden layers, this will save a lot of space. Keep an eye on the size of the checkpoint you create. You can open a terminal and enter `ls -lh` to see the sizes of the files. If your checkpoint is greater than 1 GB, reduce the size of your classifier network and re-save the checkpoint.\n",

Your application should be a pair of Python scripts that run from the command line. For testing, you should use the checkpoint you saved in the first part.\n\n### Specifications\n\nThe project submission must include at least two files `train.py` and `predict.py`. The first file, `train.py`, will train a new network on a dataset and save the model as a checkpoint. The second file, `predict.py`, uses a trained network to predict the class for an input image. Feel free to create as many other files as you need. Our suggestion is to create a file just for functions and classes relating to the model and another one for utility functions like loading data and preprocessing images. **Make sure to include all files necessary to run `train.py` and `predict.py` in your submission.**\n\n* Train a new network on a data set with `train.py`\n  * Basic usage: `python train.py data_directory`\n  * Prints out training loss, validation loss, and validation accuracy as the network trains\n  * Options:\n    * Set directory to save checkpoints: `python train.py data_dir --save_dir save_directory`\n    * Choose architecture: `python train.py data_dir --arch \"vgg13\"`\n    * Set hyperparameters: `python train.py data_dir --learning_rate 0.01 --hidden_units 512 --epochs 20`\n    * Use GPU for training: `python train.py data_dir --gpu`\n\n* Predict flower name from an image with `predict.py` along with the probability of that name. That is, you'll pass in a single image `/path/to/image` and return the flower name and class probability.\n  * Basic usage: `python predict.py /path/to/image checkpoint`\n  * Options:\n    * Return top <span class='mathquill'>K</span> most likely classes: `python predict.py input checkpoint --top_k 3`\n    * Use a mapping of categories to real names: `python predict.py input checkpoint --category_names cat_to_name.json`\n    * Use GPU for inference: `python predict.py input checkpoint --gpu`\n\nThe best way to get the command line input into the scripts is with the [argparse module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) in the standard library. You can also find [a nice tutorial for argparse here](https://pymotw.com/3/argparse/). ",
