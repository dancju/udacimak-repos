So, the rest of this lesson will be about how to really understand these equations. Along the way, you'll learn a bit about how to approach a challenge like this and learn a lot of linear algebra that will allow you to read any equations like the Kalman filter equations with relative ease! \n\nIf you are already comfortable with linear algebra, feel free to skip around this section, otherwise, let's learn more about these equations and the powerful tool: linear algebra!",

Fx models motion based on velocity, acceleration, angular velocity, etc of the object you are tracking.\n\nB is called the control matrix and u is the control vector. Bu measures  extra forces on the object you are tracking. An example would be if a robot was receiving direct commands to move in a specific direction, and you knew what those commands were and when they occurred. Like if you told your robot to move backwards 10 feet, you could model this with the Bu term.\n\nWhen you take the self-driving car engineer nanodegree, you'll use Kalman filters to track objects that are moving around your vehicle like other cars, pedestrians, bicyclists, etc. In those cases, you would ignore <span class=\"mathquill\">Bu</span> because you do not have control over the movement of other objects.

It turns out that matrices provide a very convenient and compact form for representing a vehicle's state. \n\nLet's go back to the constant velocity motion model: \n\n<span class=\"mathquill\">distance = velocity \\times time</span>\n\nThe vehicle's state is represented by the two variables distance and velocity. If you were going to store these two variables in Python, you'd probably use a list like this:\n\n```python\nstate = [distance, velocity]\n```\n\nThat Python code looks a lot like a mathematical concept called a vector. A vector is essentially a list where each element in the list contains some information. \n\nYou could imagine that a state vector could have even more information. In a two-dimensional world, the state could have a <span class=\"mathquill\">distance_x</span>, <span class=\"mathquill\">distance_y</span>, <span class=\"mathquill\">velocity_x</span> and a <span class=\"mathquill\">velocity_y</span>.\n\nIn Python, the list would look like this:\n```python\nstate = [distance_x, distance_y, velocity_x, velocity_y]\n```\n\nOr an even more complex model could include information about the turning angle of the vehicle and the turning rate:\n```python\nstate = [distance_x, distance_y, velocity_x, velocity_y, angle, angle_rate]\n```\n\n",

The <span class=\"mathquill\">\\mathbf{x}</span> vector holds the values that represent your motion model such as position and velocity. \n\nIn a basic motion model, the vector <span class=\"mathquill\">\\mathbf{x}</span> will contain information about position and linear velocity like: <span class=\"mathquill\">\\mathbf{x} = [x, y, v_x, v_y]</span>. In a physics class, these might be represented with two different vectors: a position vector and a velocity vector.\n\nA more complex motion model might take into account yaw rate, which considers a rotational angle and angular velocity around the center of the vehicle like <span class=\"mathquill\">\\mathbf{x} = [x, y, v_x, v_y, \\psi, \\dot{\\psi}]</span>.\n\nSo in order to use the Kalman filter equations and execute object tracking, you have to be familiar with vectors and how to write programs with them.",
