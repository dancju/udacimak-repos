              "text": "- **Ready** : After its creation, a process enters the ready state and is loaded into main memory. The process now is ready to run and is waiting for CPU time to be executed. Processes that are ready for execution by the CPU are stored in a queue managed by the OS.\n- **Running** : The operating system has selected the process for execution and the instructions within the process are executed on one or more of the available CPU cores.\n- **Blocked** : A process that is blocked is one that is waiting for an event (such as a system resource becoming available) or the completion of an I/O operation.\n- **Terminated** : When a process completes its execution or when it is being explicitly killed, it changes to the \"terminated\" state. The underlying program is no longer executing, but the process remains in the process table as a \"zombie process\". When it is finally removed from the process table, its lifetime ends.\n- **Ready suspended** : A process that was initially in ready state but has been swapped out of main memory and placed onto external storage is said to be in suspend ready state. The process will transition back to ready state whenever it is moved to main memory again.\n- **Blocked suspended** : A process that is blocked may also be swapped out of main memory. It may be swapped back in again under the same conditions as a \"ready suspended\" process. In such a case, the process will move to the blocked state, and may still be waiting for a resource to become available.\n\nProcesses are managed by the _scheduler_ of the OS. The scheduler can either let a process run until it ends or blocks (non-interrupting scheduler), or it can ensure that the currently running process is interrupted after a short period of time. The scheduler can switch back and forth between different active processes (interrupting scheduler), alternately assigning them CPU time. The latter is the typical scheduling strategy of any modern operating system.\n\nSince the administration of processes is computationally taxing, operating systems support a more resource-friendly way of realizing concurrent operations: the threads.\n\nA _thread_ represents a concurrent execution unit within a process. In contrast to full-blown processes as described above, threads are characterized as light-weight processes (LWP). These are significantly easier to create and destroy: In many systems the creation of a thread is up to 100 times faster than the creation of a process. This is especially advantageous in situations, when the need for concurrent operations changes dynamically.",

As illustrated by the figure above, a process can contain several threads or - if no parallel processing is provided for in the program flow - only a single thread.\n\nA major difference between a process and a thread is that each process has its own address space, while a thread does not require a new address space to be created. All the threads in a process can access its shared memory. Threads also share other OS dependent resources such as processors, files, and network connections. As a result, the management overhead for threads is typically less than for processes. Threads, however, are not protected against each other and must carefully synchronize when accessing the shared process resources to avoid conflicts.\n\nSimilar to processes, threads exist in different states, which are illustrated in the figure below:",

Also, add the created thread into the `_thread` vector of\nthe parent class.\n\n- **Task L1.3** : Vary the number of simulated vehicles in `main` and use the top function on the terminal\nor the task manager of your system to observe the number of threads used by the simulation.\n\nYou can find these tasks in the `project_tasks.txt` within the workspace as well.\n\n### Build Instructions\n_To run this code using a Udacity workspace, you will need to use the virtual desktop_. In the desktop you can use Terminator or the terminal in Visual Studio Code.\n\nOnce in the virtual desktop, to compile and run the code, create a `build` directory and use `cmake` and `make` as follows:\n```bash\nroot@a9ad274128c4:/home/workspace/L1_Project# mkdir build\nroot@a9ad274128c4:/home/workspace/L1_Project# cd build\nroot@a9ad274128c4:/home/workspace/L1_Project/build# cmake ..\nroot@a9ad274128c4:/home/workspace/L1_Project/build# make\nroot@a9ad274128c4:/home/workspace/L1_Project/build# ./traffic_simulation\n```",
