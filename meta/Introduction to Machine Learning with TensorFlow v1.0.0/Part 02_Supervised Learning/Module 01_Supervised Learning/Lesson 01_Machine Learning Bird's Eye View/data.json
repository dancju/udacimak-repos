              "text": "Unsupervised techniques are used for business applications from figuring out market segments to again building recommendation engines.  There are a lot of ways you can build recommendation engines!  But more of that will be shown in term 2.  \n\n##### These two techniques (supervised and unsupervised) will be the main techniques focused on in this term.  You will also use deep learning as a supervised learning technique for image recognition.\n\n#### Reinforcement Learning\n\nThe final type of machine learning, reinforcement learning, has recently been gaining a lot of traction, but still is limited in its use cases related to many business use cases.  There are a number of obstacles in training these algorithms, and the approaches are not as streamlined as the other approaches you will see in this term.  \n\nWith that being said, recent publicity in reinforcement learning has come from [AlphaGo](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/) and [autonomous vehicles](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2016/pdfs/112_Report.pdf).  Additionally, reinforcement learning is often used in [gaming agents like you see in Open AI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/).  \n\nThis program will not have any applications of reinforcement learning, because their use cases are not often used within common data science applications.\n\n### Looking Ahead\n\nIn the upcoming lessons, you will be diving into supervised learning using sklearn (also called scikit-learn).  Luis, who used to be a machine learning engineer at Google, will be guiding you through the most common tools and concepts needed to master these techniques!",
