So even though it has the word `origin` is not actually the original repository.\n\nRemember that the names `origin` and `upstream` are just the default or de facto names that are used. If it's clearer for you to name your `origin` remote `mine` and the `upstream` remote `source-repo`, then by all means, go ahead and rename them.

In the command `git rebase -i HEAD~3`, we're telling Git to use `HEAD~3` as the base where all of the other commits (`HEAD~2`, `HEAD~1`, and `HEAD`) will connect to.\n\nThe `-i` in the command stands for \"interactive\". You _can_ perform a rebase in a non-interactive mode. While you're learning how to rebase, though, I definitely recommend that you do _interactive_ rebasing.\n\n### Ancestry References\n\nAs a brief refresher, `HEAD` indicates your current location (it could point to several things, but typically it'll either point to a branch name or directly to a commit's SHA). The `~3` part means \"three before\", so `HEAD~3` will be the commit that's three before the one you're currently on. We're using this relative reference to a commit in the `git rebase` command.\n\nLet me demonstrate how to use this command to combine the three destination commits into one.",

It can help you edit commit messages, reorder commits, combine commits, etc. So it truly is a powerhouse of a tool. Now the question becomes \"_When_ should you rebase?\". \n\nWhenever you rebase commits, Git will create a new SHA _for each commit_! This has drastic implications. To Git, the SHA is the identifier for a commit, so a different identifier means it's a different commit, _regardless if the content has changed at all._ \n\nSo you should not rebase if you have already pushed the commits you want to rebase. If you're collaborating with other developers, then they might already be working with the commits you've pushed. If you then use `git rebase` to change things around and then force push the commits, then the other developers will now be out of sync with the remote repository.  They will have to do some complicated surgery to their Git repository to get their repo back in a working state...and it might not even be possible for them to do that; they might just have to scrap all of their work and start over with your newly-rebased, force-pushed commits.",
