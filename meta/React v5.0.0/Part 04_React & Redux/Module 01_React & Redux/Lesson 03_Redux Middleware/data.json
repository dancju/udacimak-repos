In turn, the reducer produces the _new_ state. This new state replaces the previous state in the store. So the next time `store.getState()` is called, the new, most up-to-date state is returned.\n\nBetween the dispatching of an action and the reducer running, we can introduce code called **middleware** to _intercept_ the action before the reducer is invoked. The [Redux docs](http://redux.js.org/docs/advanced/Middleware.html) describe middleware as:\n\n> …a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer.\n\nWhat's great about middleware is that once it receives the action, it can carry out a number of operations, including:\n\n* producing a side effect (e.g., logging information about the store)\n* processing the action itself (e.g., making an asynchronous HTTP request)\n* redirecting the action (e.g., to another piece of middleware)\n* dispatching supplementary actions\n\n…or even some combination of the above! Middleware can do any of these _before_ passing the action along to the reducer.\n\nLet's replace our `checkAndDispatch()` function with a real Redux middleware function.",

              "text": "# Where Middleware Fits\n\nThe way we had to structure our code originally, our `checkAndDispatch()` function _had_ to run *before* `store.dispatch()`. Why is this? Because when `store.dispatch()` is invoked, it immediately calls the reducer that was passed in when `createStore()` was invoked. If you remember back to the first lesson, this is what our `dispatch()` function looked like (and is very similar to the real Redux `dispatch()` function):\n\n```js\nconst dispatch = (action) => {\n state = reducer(state, action)\n listeners.forEach((listener) => listener())\n}\n```\n\nSo you can see that calling `store.dispatch()` will _immediately_ invoke the `reducer()` function. There's no way to run anything in between the two function calls. So that's why we had to make our `checkAndDispatch()` so that we can run verification code _before_ calling `store.dispatch()`.\n\nHowever, this isn't maintainable. If we wanted to add another check, then we'd need to write _another_ preceding function, that then calls `checkAndDispatch()` that _then_ calls `store.dispatch()`. Not maintainable at all.\n\nWith Redux's middleware feature, we can run code _between_ the call to `store.dispatch()` and `reducer()`. The reason this works, is because Redux's version of `dispatch()` is a bit more sophisticated than ours was, and because we provide the middleware functions when we create the store.\n\n```js\nconst store = Redux.createStore( <reducer-function>, <middleware-functions> )\n```\n\nRedux's `createStore()` method takes the reducer function as its first argument, but then it can take a second argument of the middleware functions to run. Because we set up the Redux store with knowledge of the middleware function, it runs the middleware function between `store.dispatch()` and the invocation of the reducer.",

More specifically, we can pass in the `applyMiddleware()` function as an optional argument into `createStore()`. Here's `applyMiddleware()`'s signature:\n\n```js\napplyMiddleware(...middlewares)\n```\n\nNote the spread operator on the `middlewares` parameter. This means that we can pass in as many different middleware as we want! Middleware is called in the order in which they were provided to `applyMiddleware()`. \n\nWe currently have the `checker` middleware applied to our app, but we'll soon add a new `logger` middleware as well. To create a Redux store that uses our `checker` middleware, we can do the following:\n\n```js\nconst store = Redux.createStore(rootReducer, Redux.applyMiddleware(checker))\n```",

              "text": "> ## 💡Functions Returning Functions 💡\n>\n> Redux middleware leverages a concept called **higher-order functions**. A higher-order function is a function that either:\n>\n> * _accepts_ a function as an argument \n> * _returns_ a function\n>\n> Higher-order functions are a powerful programming technique that allow functions to be significantly more dynamic. You've actually already written a higher-order function in this course. The `createRemoveButton()` function is a higher-order function because the `onClick` parameter is expected to be a function (because `onClick` is set up as an event listener callback function.\n>\n> For a refresher on higher-order functions, feel free to check out Lesson 2 in [Object-Oriented JavaScript](https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud711).",

Because we can use multiple middleware functions in a single application, let's create a new middleware function called `logger` that will log out information about the state and action.\n\nThe benefits of this `logger()` middleware function are huge while developing the application. We'll use this middleware to intercept all dispatch calls and log out what the action is that's being dispatched and what the state changes to _after_ the reducer has run. Being able to see this kind of information will be immensely helpful while we're developing our app. We can use this info to help us know what's going on in our app and to help us track down any pesky bugs that creep in.
